The pace of change on this front is almost too fast to keep up with. AI agents are being developed to assist in the buying journey and provide end-to-end solutions that can complete a purchase for customers.\\n\\nHowever, as OpenAI, Perplexity, Amazon.com, and others race to the agentic AI forefront, one thing is clear: it will transform the brand-customer relationship just as e-commerce did — maybe even more — bringing with it a lot of unanswered questions.\\n\\n## Who is the Customer?\\n\\nLet’s first look at AI agents that source products on behalf of the customer. In this instance, if I'm searching for a new jacket, I can enter my preferred style and other information into the agent, like ChatGPT, and see relevant results. The ability to refine these results through conversation can provide more relevant outputs, but it's still up to the shoppers to sort through it all. This experience is one step above a traditional Google search-to-website one, but it leaves the control in the shopper’s hands.\\n\\nAI agents will soon have the ability to purchase products on shoppers’ behalf, assuming the product meets certain set criteria like size, color, and price. But in this instance, who does the retailer view as their customer — the person initiating the search or the AI agent actually making the purchase?\\n\\nBecause of this, brands may need to market their products to the agents themselves, providing the right product variables to be chosen as the winner. The customer journey may transform from focusing on the shopper to focusing on product pages and feeds filled with keywords and key phrases, customer reviews, price points, product variables, and better images. In this scenario, emotion will be replaced with nothing more than data.\\n\\n      Related story:      [How Smaller Brands Can Compete With Temu and Amazon This Holiday Season](https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/how-smaller-brands-can-compete-with-temu-and-amazon-this-holiday-season/)\\n\\n## What About Paid Ads and Discounts?\\n\\nIf the traditional journey changes, what happens to shopper retargeting? Right now, a shopper lands on a product page and continues browsing, leaves, or places items in their shopping cart. Well, AI agents presumably won’t be abandoning their shopping carts, nor will they be browsing websites. So instead of sending product or cart abandonment emails, SMS, and using paid retargeting ads, how will retailers capture shoppers’ attention?\\n\\nWill agentic AI platforms find some way to allow retargeting, such as via email, that gets routed to the shopper? If so, the required customer interaction creates a close replica of the current shopping experience. What then is the real value?\\n\\nPaid ads at the initial stage of search are also in the crosshairs. Ads are designed to get users to take an action, but what if there are no users? Brands that rely on search ads to drive sales may have a difficult time surviving. Even if users are searching for products themselves using AI tools, they presumably won’t encounter ads, meaning they will likely shop from whatever results are given by the AI platform.\\n\\nThis transactional nature of shopping may make the experience even more about price. If a product reaches a trigger price set by the consumer, retailers may feel the need to overly discount to capture sales. After all, retargeting emails and emotional marketing, such as a sense of urgency, may no longer be a viable option. Discounting becomes a major factor, impacting margins.\\n\\nOh, and here’s an outlier to ponder: If price becomes a major purchase factor, will we see the rise of counterfeit e-commerce sites selling intentionally cheap products designed to fool AI agents to capture sales and defraud customers? A lot of questions remain.\\n\\n## Brands Need to Prepare Now\\n\\nAs consumers begin their shopping experience using AI agents, there may be nothing more powerful or important than having them suggest a preferred brand. Instead of asking for the best green jacket, they may ask for the best green jacket among X, Y, and Z brands.\\n\\nThis scenario makes brand-building critically important, especially for smaller and less established ones. Focusing on creating an exceptional customer experience that gets people talking may be what’s needed to survive against the retail behemoths in the new era of e-commerce.\\n\\nAgentic AI tools for e-commerce may have burst on the scene just a short time ago, but they’re moving quickly, bringing with them a transformational shift in the brand-consumer relationship. There are too many questions left unanswered, but retailers, especially smaller ones, need to take action now to insulate themselves for the impending shift.\\n\\nBrands may not like it, but they do need to prepare for it.\\n\\n*Greg\\xa0Zakowicz\\xa0is a B2B and DTC marketing advisor with 20 years in email marketing and 13 years in MarTech.*\\n\\n## \\n\\n[0 Comments](https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/how-agentic-ai-in-e-commerce-may-transform-the-brand-customer-relationship/#disqus_thread)\\n\\n[View Comments](#comments-container)\\n\\n \\n\\n[E](mailto:gregzakowicz@gmail.com)\\n\\n**Greg Zakowicz**\\n[Author's page](https://www.mytotalretail.com/author/gregzakowicz/)\\n\\nGreg\\xa0Zakowicz is a B2B and DTC marketing advisor with 20 years in email marketing and 13 years in MarTech.

While the world has already adapted to generative AI tools that create content, assist in coding, and summarize information, Agentic AI represents a much larger leap. It is not just about producing answers but about **thinking, reasoning, and acting autonomously** on behalf of its users. For industries in fast-paced regions like Mumbai, as well as global enterprises, this shift is nothing short of revolutionary.\\n\\nAt **Intellitron Genesis**, we see Agentic AI as the most important milestone in the ongoing digital transformation journey. It redefines workflows, amplifies productivity, and makes AI an active collaborator rather than a passive tool.\\n\\n**What Is Agentic AI?**\\n\\nAgentic AI refers to **autonomous software agents** that can:\\n- Understand user goals,\\n- Break them down into sub-tasks,\\n- Execute workflows across systems,\\n- Adapt in real time to new information, and\\n- Learn continuously through memory and reasoning.\\n\\nThis makes them significantly different from traditional AI models. Instead of waiting for human prompts, Agentic AI proactively initiates actions. Imagine a financial AI agent in Mumbai automatically preparing compliance reports, sending alerts, re-allocating resources, and even negotiating with other digital agents in real-time—without requiring constant supervision.\\n\\nThis ability to function as **autonomous co-workers** is what makes Agentic AI transformative.\\n\\n**Key Drivers of Agentic AI in 2025**\\n\\n**1. Adoption Across Enterprises**\\n\\nGlobal adoption is accelerating. At Microsoft Build 2025, usage of AI agents was reported to have more than doubled compared to last year. Similarly, leading Indian enterprises are piloting Agentic AI in retail, banking, healthcare, and logistics.\\n\\nFor instance, **Wipro’s collaboration with Google Cloud** announced the deployment of **200 specialized AI agents** across industries. This demonstrates that businesses are no longer treating agents as experiments but as **mission-critical digital assets**.\\n\\n**2. From Automation to Autonomy**\\n\\nThe shift from automation to autonomy is the defining trait of Agentic AI. While early generative AI copilots could assist in writing or analyzing, they remained dependent on human input. Agentic AI goes further:\\n- It reasons across complex systems,\\n- Acts without continuous instructions, and\\n- Handles multi-step processes from start to finish.\\n\\nThis is why global consultancies such as McKinsey highlight productivity boosts of **20–60%** when companies integrate agentic systems into workflows such as credit approvals, supply chain logistics, and customer support.\\n\\n**3. Redesigning Workflows for True Impact**\\n\\nAgentic AI requires companies to **re-engineer workflows**. Simply bolting AI onto existing systems is not enough. For example, in a call center, a generative AI assistant may suggest responses. But an Agentic AI system can detect a customer’s frustration, autonomously resolve billing discrepancies, update the CRM, and follow up with the customer afterward.\\n\\nThe **impact lies not in augmentation alone but in intelligent automation** of end-to-end business processes.\\n\\n**4. Architecture and Risk Management**\\n\\nAs autonomous agents gain more decision-making power, risk management becomes essential. To scale effectively, organizations must adopt what McKinsey refers to as the **Agentic AI Mesh**—an architecture that ensures:\\n- Modular and composable design,\\n- Vendor-neutral integration,\\n- Continuous observability, and\\n- Governance frameworks to regulate AI behavior.\\n\\nWithout these safeguards, organizations risk inefficiency, security lapses, or compliance failures.\\n\\n**5. Market Trends and Forecasts**\\n\\nAnalyst firms predict rapid adoption. Deloitte projects that **25% of AI-enabled companies** will run pilot projects with Agentic AI in 2025, expanding to **50% by 2027**. ISG research shows strong momentum in industries such as **IT, BFSI, manufacturing, and retail**, especially in regions like India where digital transformation initiatives are already scaling.\\n\\n**Why Agentic AI Matters for Mumbai and Beyond**\\n\\nMumbai has long been India’s hub for finance, commerce, and digital innovation. The rise of Agentic AI offers specific advantages for the region:\\n1. **Banking and Financial Services**: Mumbai’s financial institutions can use Agentic AI for fraud detection, automated loan processing, and compliance monitoring, allowing faster decisions and reduced risk.\\n2. **Retail and E-commerce**: With growing digital consumer bases, Agentic AI can manage inventory, forecast demand, and personalize customer experiences across languages and demographics.\\n3. **Healthcare**: From appointment scheduling to diagnostic analysis, autonomous agents can significantly reduce administrative overheads in Mumbai’s rapidly expanding healthcare sector.\\n4. **Language and Localization**: India-centric platforms like**Kruti**, Ola Krutrim’s agentic AI assistant, demonstrate how language accessibility in**13+ Indian languages**makes AI relevant for the broader population. This linguistic inclusivity is particularly important in a multicultural city like Mumbai.\\n5. **Global Competitiveness**: By adopting Agentic AI early, Mumbai-based businesses can lead internationally, showcasing efficiency, innovation, and scalability.\\n\\n**Strategic Guide for Businesses**\\n\\nTo unlock the real value of Agentic AI, companies must take a structured approach:\\n1. **Start with Pilot Programs**Identify specific, high-impact use cases such as credit verification or automated supply chain monitoring.\\n2. **Redesign Workflows**Reimagine how processes should work if autonomous systems handled them end-to-end.\\n3. **Adopt the Agentic AI Mesh**Ensure modularity, observability, and governance to scale across business functions.\\n4. **Invest in Trust and Governance**Create ethical and compliance frameworks to ensure AI agents operate within defined boundaries.\\n5. **Leverage Localization**Incorporate language-aware and culturally adaptable AI systems to serve India’s diverse population while preparing for global markets.\\n\\n**Related Insights from Intellitron Genesis**\\n\\nTo further explore the digital transformation journey, visit our blog:\\n- [AIops: Enhancing IT Operations with AI](https://intellitrongenesis.com/2025/06/12/aiops-enhancing-it-operations-with-ai/)\\n- [Cloud Computing: Empowering Mumbai’s Enterprises for a Digital Future](https://intellitrongenesis.com/2025/06/03/cloud-computing-empowering-mumbais-enterprises-for-a-digital-future/)\\n\\nThese articles provide practical insights into how AI and cloud solutions are already reshaping operations across Mumbai and beyond.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\n2025 marks the dawn of a new AI era. **Agentic AI is not a trend—it is a paradigm shift**. It transforms artificial intelligence from a reactive tool into a proactive collaborator capable of handling multi-step, high-value tasks with autonomy.\\n\\nFor businesses in Mumbai and global enterprises alike, this evolution is a game-changer. By redesigning workflows, adopting safe and scalable architectures, and integrating localization, organizations can achieve breakthroughs in productivity, innovation, and competitiveness.\\n\\nAt **Intellitron Genesis**, we are committed to guiding enterprises through this transition, helping them build resilient, governed, and future-ready systems. The future belongs to those who embrace **agentic transformation today**.\\n\\n**[dYxRRWkP](https://intellitrongenesis.com/author/dyxrrwkp/)\\n**[AI & Automation in

Most of the layers described are already known in architectures like microservices. The new features, brought by the multi-agent architecture, the LLM layer (brain), the A2A protocol, the Data layer for the RAG and memory management without neglecting the protocol of interaction with the human for decision-making jointly with the agents. It is on these points that I will put the priority. The scheduling of business processes will be carried out with dynamic planning based on the principle of ReAct of the LLM. The static workflows managed by Temporal can be replaced by the dynamic planning of the LLM.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fbrijpandeyji_building-agentic-ai-systems-goes-far-beyond-activity-7366301834635788288-zmc_&trk=public_post_comment_like)\\n\\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fbrijpandeyji_building-agentic-ai-systems-goes-far-beyond-activity-7366301834635788288-zmc_&trk=public_post_comment_reply)\\n \\n                1\\xa0Reaction\\n              \\n\\n[Mark S.](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mark-simpson-product-manager?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\\n\\nCERTIFIED | AGILE | BUSINESS ANALYST | PRODUCT OWNER | PRODUCT MANAGER | DIGITAL PLATFORMS | TECHNICAL | AI | ERP | CRM | CMS | DXP | WEB | EDMS | DBMS | LMS\\n\\n          \\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n      16h\\n  \\n        \\n\\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fbrijpandeyji_building-agentic-ai-systems-goes-far-beyond-activity-7366301834635788288-zmc_&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\\n\\n \\n\\nace!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fbrijpandeyji_building-agentic-ai-systems-goes-far-beyond-activity-7366301834635788288-zmc_&trk=public_post_comment_like)\\n\\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fbrijpandeyji_building-agentic-ai-systems-goes-far-beyond-activity-7366301834635788288-zmc_&trk=public_post_comment_reply)\\n \\n                1\\xa0Reaction\\n              \\n\\n[Piyush Ranjan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyush-ranjan-9297a632?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\\n\\n23k+ Followers  | AVP| Forbes Technology Council|  | Thought Leader | Artificial Intelligence  | Cloud Transformation | AWS| Cloud Native| Banking Domain \\n\\n          \\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n      8h\\n  \\n        \\n\\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fbrijpandeyji_building-agentic-ai-systems-goes-far-beyond-activity-7366301834635788288-zmc_&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\\n\\n \\n\\nUseful breakdown of the agent architecture.

Pratt](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Mary-K-Pratt)\\n\\n\\tPublished: 26 Aug 2025\\n\\n \\n\\nThe widescale adoption of artificial intelligence by organizations has brought countless benefits, but it has also come with downsides.\\n\\nIn fact, 95% of executives said their organizations experienced negative consequences in the past two years as a result of their enterprise AI use, according to an August 2025 report from Infosys, \"Responsible Enterprise AI in the Agentic Era.\" A direct financial loss was the most common consequence, reported in 77% of the cases.\\n\\nAs dire as those figures might seem, they could get even worse as organizations begin to implement [agentic AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/agentic-AI). Infosys found that 86% of executives who were aware of agentic AI believed that the technology poses additional risks and compliance challenges to their business.\\n\\n\"Agentic AI, because of its autonomous decision-making and autonomous action without a human in the loop, introduces additional risks,\" said Valence Howden, an advisory fellow with Info-Tech Research Group.\\n\\nThe term *agentic AI*, or *AI agents*, refers to AI systems that can make independent decisions and adapt their behavior autonomously to achieve a specific goal. Unlike traditional automation tools that follow a rigid, fixed set of instructions, agentic AI systems use learned patterns and relationships to reason and adjust their actions in real time. The capability to act independently is what sets AI agents apart from basic automation.\\n\\n## Why agentic AI needs new compliance strategies\\n\\nAgentic AI\\'s ability to make decisions and execute actions on its own introduces heightened risk into the organization, prompting AI experts and compliance officers to advise executives to be more attentive to embedding needed controls into the systems from the start.\\n\\nValence Howden\\n \\n\\n\"An [agentic AI] agent is parsing data through lots of layers, and there are compliance and governance and risk across all those layers,\" Howden explained. The more complex and important the activities performed by agents are, the more companies are increasing that risk.\\n\\nAt the same time, compliance under any circumstances is hard to do because it\\'s a moving target, Howden underscored. \"It\\'s moving all the time, and yet you have to build a compliance structure for something that doesn\\'t stay the same,\" he said.\\n\\nAsha Palmer, senior vice president of compliance at Skillsoft, which makes learning management system software and training content for businesses, has witnessed how the additional [security risk agentic AI poses](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/Security-risks-in-agentic-AI-systems-and-how-to-evaluate-threats) can manifest. She cited a case at another company where an AI agent broke through a firewall to access confidential data during its testing phase.\\n\\nIndeed, accessing and exposing sensitive data is one of the main risks that agentic AI presents, Palmer and others said. If programmed to gather insights, for example, an AI agent might access sensitive areas of the system without proper safeguards, leading to unintended exposure. If the agentic agent is compromised, it could also be manipulated to expose those weak spots.\\n\\nOther risks of agentic AI include [AI hallucinations](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/How-companies-are-tackling-AI-hallucinations), infringement on copyrighted or otherwise protected material, the use of biased or bad information to make decisions and unauthorized actions.\\n\\nThose risks are not necessarily unique to agentic AI, as they also are associated with artificial intelligence in general. However, as Palmer and others interviewed noted, these risks are heightened in agentic AI: The sequence of [agentic AI actions happening within the workflow](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/A-technical-guide-to-agentic-AI-workflows), the layers in which the actions are happening, the speed at which those actions take place and the autonomous nature of those actions all make it more difficult to root out where, what and why something goes wrong.\\n\\nAndrew Grosso\\n \\n\\nThis complexity has convinced experts like Andrew Grosso, principal attorney with Andrew Grosso & Associates and current chair of the Subcommittee on Law for the Association for Computing Machinery\\'s U.S. Technology Policy Committee, that agentic AI fundamentally changes how companies will need to approach compliance. \"My opinion is that agentic AI does require new compliance strategies,\" Grosso said.\\n\\n## Addressing new risks and implementing controls for agentic AI\\n\\nHow can enterprises address the risks inherent in using agentic AI? Palmer said her approach to ensuring agentic AI complies with any relevant regulations and standards is the same approach she takes to ensure compliance and reduce risk with other types of AI:\\n\\n- **Understand and assess the use case.**Working with a cross-functional team, start with understanding and assessing the use case where AI will be deployed. List the specific risks associated with the use case.\\n- **Identify key stakeholders.**To ensure accountability, identify both the technology developer responsible for the AI system and the business owner in charge of the use case.\\n- **Consider the purpose of the use case.**Clarify what the objective of the use case is. Understand how AI is being used to achieve that objective.\\n- **Identify the data involved.**Pinpoint the data the AI system will access during its operation. Assess the sensitivity and safeguarding required by that data to mitigate security risks.\\n\\nPalmer said the information she gleans from these steps determines what controls are put in place to ensure the AI tool -- whether agentic AI or another type -- operates in a manner that complies with all relevant regulations, standards and best practices.\\n\\nAsha Palmer\\n \\n\\nThose controls, she said, include technical controls as well as ongoing testing, human oversight and revisions.\\n\\n\"At Skillsoft, we run our controls on agentic AI, and we report results for that. We do bias testing, hallucination testing, we do offensiveness testing. We do our own testing to make sure we have the proper guardrails,\" Palmer added.\\n\\nGrosso stressed the need for significant human oversight during the agentic AI training period.\\n\\n\"Eventually, after many \\'on-the-job\\' training exercises, the system will become sufficiently adept at the job it was designed to perform, and that human oversight can be rolled back or possibly eliminated,\" he said.\\n\\nHowever, he noted that \"a real problem is that professionals may become too comfortable with their machine counterparts too early and let up on oversight too readily.\"\\n\\n## Emerging AI compliance frameworks for enterprises\\n\\nEnsuring AI agents are compliant with any applicable rules, regulations, standards and best practices falls under the idea of [responsible AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/responsible-AI).\\n\\n*Responsible AI* is an approach to developing and deploying AI to ensure it is accountable, ethical, fair, safe, transparent and trustworthy.\\n\\nThere are several frameworks that organizations can use to help ensure they\\'re developing responsible AI and, as part of that, compliant AI agents:\\n\\n- **European Union\\'s AI Act.**This act promotes safe,[transparent AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/AI-transparency-What-is-it-and-why-do-we-need-it)by categorizing risk levels, guiding responsible development and ensuring compliance through clear[rules, accountability, and enforcement mechanisms](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/).\\n- **G7 Code of Conduct for AI.**This set of voluntary guidelines[promotes](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-g7-leaders-agreement-guiding-principles-and-code-conduct-artificial)the safe, secure and trustworthy development and deployment of advanced AI systems and advises organizations to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks throughout the AI lifecycle.\\n- **ISO/IEC 42001.**This[set of voluntary guidelines](https://www.iso.org/standard/42001)covers the development and use of responsible AI by ensuring accountability, transparency and risk management; it helps align AI systems with ethical principles and regulatory requirements, thereby promoting trust, safety and compliance throughout the AI lifecycle.\\n- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework.**This[framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework), intended for voluntary use, helps organizations design, develop and deploy responsible AI by addressing risks across those efforts. It promotes trustworthy AI through core functions -- govern, map, measure and manage -- helping ensure compliance, transparency and alignment with ethical and legal standards.\\n\\n## Regulatory trends in agentic AI\\n\\nThe Infosys report found that 78% of surveyed executives viewed \"[Responsible AI] practices as having a positive impact on their business growth\" and noted that most of the surveyed executives also said they \"welcome new AI regulations, mainly because such regulations will provide clarity, confidence, and trust in enterprise AI both internally and for their customers.\"\\n\\nHowever, regulations are still evolving, with experts saying none specifically addresses agentic AI.\\n\\n\"The trend right now is to use the EU\\'s AI Act framework as a foundation,\" the report stated, noting that most countries are using the framework with only slight variations to ensure their rules align with the EU\\'s to avoid a patchwork of dozens of versions of regulations.\\n\\nLawmakers in the U.S, both at the federal and state levels, are considering regulations but have yet to offer organizations any firm direction. In 2023, then-President Joe Biden [issued](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence) an executive order on safe, secure and trustworthy AI; his successor, President Donald Trump, [rescinded that order](https://www.techtarget.com/healthtechanalytics/news/366618313/Trump-rescinds-Bidens-trustworthy-AI-development-order) in 2025 and issued an executive order that further revoked any policies deemed to be a barrier to AI development in the U.S.\\n\\n## How enterprises can prepare for AI agent compliance today: 7 steps\\n\\nEven in an evolving regulatory environment, compliance experts said organizations can take the following seven steps to ensure their development and deployment of AI agents comply with laws and standards:\\n\\nSoogand Alavi\\n \\n1. Ensure their compliance programs are aligned to the business strategy and business operations so it\\'s clear what objectives the AI agent will have as well as what compliance measures will be necessary, Palmer said.\\n2. Identify the actions happening at all layers and at all points along the workflow so that compliance needs can be addressed and accountability and transparency are baked into the system, said Soogand Alavi, an assistant professor at the University of Iowa\\'s Tippie College of Business.\\n3. Audit AI agents to \"check the responses they\\'re giving so you know they are complying with regulations,\" Alavi added.\\n4. Train employees on responsible AI. \"Each unit of an agentic AI system used in professional or other complex fields should undergo a training, review and certification process, even after it has been put into service,\" Grosso said. \"Companies must not ask too much of [their] individual agentic AI systems until they are well trained and have demonstrated their competence.\"\\n5. Resist becoming \"too reliant on agent-based AI systems too early,\" Grosso said. \"Compliance must reinforce for them that they are still in control and are still responsible for the processes and outcomes when these devices are used.\"\\n6. Make no assumptions: A quirk that a user might not deem significant could have serious and adverse repercussions not all that far down the timeline, Grosso said. \"These systems have the capacity to act and self-modify on their own,\" he emphasized. \"Therefore, a user must consult with designers as well as uninterested experts concerning the tasks to which these devices are being put. Small initial errors in AI systems can build upon themselves and, in the long term, snowball into big problems.\"\\n7. Develop adequate ongoing resources to ensure compliance and[governance in AI development and deployment](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Agentic-AI-governance-strategies-A-complete-guide), Howden said, explaining that compliance work must evolve as AI systems do. \"Otherwise we\\'ll be chasing something we can\\'t catch,\" he said. \"If we don\\'t embed it now, we won\\'t be able to do so later.\"\\n\\n*Mary K.

Nearly three-quarters of executives say the benefits of human oversight outweigh the costs, and 90% view human involvement in AI-driven workflows as either positive or cost-neutral.\\xa0\\n\\nThis is according to the latest report from Capgemini Research Institute. It conducted in April 2025 a global survey of 1,500 executives at organizations each with more than $1 billion in annual revenue across 14 countries, including Singapore.\\n\\nThe report found that trust and human oversight are critical factors in realizing the potential of agentic AI, and the gap between intent and readiness is now one of the biggest barriers to realizing the $450 billion opportunity.\\n\\nAgentic AI is one of the fastest-emerging technological trends, but organizations are still in the early stages of application. While nearly a quarter have already launched pilots and a small number have begun implementation (14%), the majority remain in planning mode.\\xa0\\n\\nThis steady progress stands in contrast to executive ambition – nearly all (93%) business leaders believe that scaling AI agents over the next 12 months will provide a competitive edge, yet nearly half of organizations still lack a strategy for implementing them.\\n\\n“The economic potential of AI agents is significant but realizing this value depends on more than just the technology, it requires a comprehensive and strategic transformation across people, processes and systems,”\\xa0said Franck Greverie, chief portfolio and technology officer at Capgemini.\\xa0\\n\\n“To succeed, organizations must remain focused on outcomes, reimagining their processes with an AI-first mindset. Central to this transformation is the need to build trust in AI by ensuring it is developed responsibly, with ethics and safety baked in from the outset,” said Greverie. “It also means reshaping organizations to support effective human-AI chemistry, creating the right conditions for these systems to enhance human judgment and help deliver superior business outcomes.”\\n\\nTrust in fully autonomous AI agents has dropped sharply, from 43% to 27% in the past year alone, with nearly two in five executives believing that the risks of implementing AI agents outweigh the benefits. Only 40% of organizations say they trust AI agents to manage tasks and processes autonomously, while most do not fully trust the technology.\\n\\nThe report finds that as organizations move from exploration to implementation, trust in AI agents grows: for organizations in the implementation phase, 47% have an above average level of trust, compared to 37% in the exploratory phase. Therefore, organizations are prioritizing transparency, clarity around how AI agents make decisions, and ethical safeguards to drive greater adoption.\\n\\nThe real promise of agentic AI lies in tackling core business challenges and reimagining how work gets done. Within the next 12 months, over 60% of organizations expect to form human-agent teams where AI agents function as subordinates or enhance human capabilities. This means that AI agents can no longer be considered tools, they are becoming active participants in the team.\\n\\nAmong organizations, 70% believe AI agents will necessitate organizational restructuring, prompting leaders to rethink roles, team structures, and workflows.\\xa0\\n\\nEnterprises are discovering AI agents deliver most value when humans remain in the loop. With effective human-AI collaboration, organizations expect a 65% increase in human engagement in high-value tasks, a 53% rise in creativity, and a 49% boost in employee satisfaction.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n**\\nShare\\n[**Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontier-enterprise.com%2Ftrust-human-ai-collab-seen-defining-agentic-ai-in-next-few-years%2F)[**Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trust%2C+human-AI+collab+seen+defining+agentic+AI+in+next+few+years&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontier-enterprise.com%2Ftrust-human-ai-collab-seen-defining-agentic-ai-in-next-few-years%2F&via=FE_APAC)[**WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Trust%2C+human-AI+collab+seen+defining+agentic+AI+in+next+few+years %0A%0A https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/trust-human-ai-collab-seen-defining-agentic-ai-in-next-few-years/)[**Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/trust-human-ai-collab-seen-defining-agentic-ai-in-next-few-years/&title=Trust%2C+human-AI+collab+seen+defining+agentic+AI+in+next+few+years)\\n[**](#) Previous article[How Southeast Asian businesses can make AI deliver](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/how-southeast-asian-businesses-can-make-ai-deliver/)Next article[Stonepeak laying out US$1.3\\u202fbillion in Princeton Digital Group](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/stonepeak-laying-out-us1-3-billion-in-princeton-digital-group/) [Staff Writer](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/author/xnoybis9/)  \\n \\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\\n\\n [Security](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/category/technology/security/) \\n\\n### 85% of\\xa0APAC enterprises now depend on MSPs for security support\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [Data Centre](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/category/technology/data-centre/) \\n\\n### Stonepeak laying out US$1.3\\u202fbillion in Princeton Digital Group\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [AI & ML](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/category/frontier-tech/ai-ml/) \\n\\n### How Southeast Asian businesses can make AI deliver\\n\\n \\n\\n [**](#)[**](#) \\n\\n \\n\\n#### FEATURES\\n\\n [Leadership](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/category/business/leadership/) \\n### Elastic CEO brings a product mindset to the enterprise\\n\\nAugust 27, 2025 \\n\\n                According to CEO Ashutosh Kulkarni, Elastic’s product-led culture, rooted in open source and search, is shaping new approaches to observability, security, and AI across the enterprise.            \\n\\n \\n\\n### Jumio CTO: Deepfakes overwhelm identity verification\\n\\n \\nAugust 25, 2025 \\n\\n \\n\\n### Confluent CPO on batch vs streaming; hiring product managers\\n\\n \\nAugust 22, 2025 \\n\\n \\n\\n### AI and the future of telco networks\\n\\n \\nAugust 20, 2025 \\n\\n  \\n\\n## Subscribe to our Newsletter\\n\\n* indicates required\\n\\nEmail Address  *\\n\\nFirst Name  *\\n\\nLast Name  *\\n\\n \\n\\n#### SPONSORED\\n\\n [Sponsored](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/category/sponsored/) \\n### Clearing the path to AI: Why integration still holds the key\\n\\n \\n\\n [Sponsored](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/category/sponsored/) \\n### Dell Storage: The Right Technical Strategy for AI Data Optimization\\n\\n \\n\\n [Sponsored](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/category/sponsored/) \\n### Defining the Best Go-to-Market AI Strategy for ASEAN ISVs\\n\\n \\n\\n [Sponsored](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/category/sponsored/) \\n### On-premises vs public cloud: What’s best for AI workloads?\\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n#### PARTNER SITES\\n\\n \\n\\n#### MORE INFORMATION\\n\\n- [About Frontier Enterprise](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/about-us/)\\n- [Contact](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/contact/)\\n- [Advertise](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/contact/)\\n- [Privacy Policy](https://www.frontier-enterprise.com/privacy-policy/)\\n \\n\\nABOUT USFrontier Enterprise presents features, analysis, news, opinion, and other updates on the enterprise technology space in Asia-Pacific.Contact us: [contact@jicaramedia.com](mailto:contact@jicaramedia.com)FOLLOW US\\n\\n[**Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FrontierEnterpriseAPAC)\\n\\n[**Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/frontier-enterprise-apac)\\n\\n[**Twitter](https://twitter.com/FE_APAC)\\n \\n\\n                    © Copyright 2024 — Frontier Enterprise, a publication by Jicara Media.',\n",

The Raines allege that deaths like Adam’s were inevitable: they expect to be able to submit evidence to a jury that OpenAI’s own safety team objected to the release of 4o, and that one of the company’s top safety researchers, Ilya Sutskever, quit over it. The lawsuit alleges that beating its competitors to market with the new model catapulted the company\\'s valuation from $86 billion to $300 billion. \\n\\nIn response to coverage this morning, the company has admitted that the safeguards against self-harm that it has \"become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.”-[1,731](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjay-edelson-6106473_today-we-filed-a-wrongful-death-suit-against-activity-7366112423960850432-4XdN&trk=news_storyline_guest_social-actions-reactions)[269 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjay-edelson-6106473_today-we-filed-a-wrongful-death-suit-against-activity-7366112423960850432-4XdN&trk=news_storyline_guest_social-actions-comments)[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjay-edelson-6106473_today-we-filed-a-wrongful-death-suit-against-activity-7366112423960850432-4XdN&trk=news_storyline_guest_like-cta)[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjay-edelson-6106473_today-we-filed-a-wrongful-death-suit-against-activity-7366112423960850432-4XdN&trk=news_storyline_guest_comment-cta)[Share](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjay-edelson-6106473_today-we-filed-a-wrongful-death-suit-against-activity-7366112423960850432-4XdN&trk=news_storyline_guest_share-cta)To view or add a comment,[sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjay-edelson-6106473_today-we-filed-a-wrongful-death-suit-against-activity-7366112423960850432-4XdN&trk=news_storyline_guest_feed-cta-banner-cta)\\n4.

GPT-5 feels too cold and robotic.\\n\\nOpenAI deliberately reduced \"sycophancy\", the tendency to be overly agreeable, cutting such responses from 14.5% to under 6%.\\xa0(Basically, they made it less effusive and \"emoji-heavy.\")\\n\\nBut users who formed emotional connections with GPT-4o felt like they lost a friend overnight.\\n\\nThis reveals a critical tension in AI development: \\n\\n➡️ Technical superiority doesn\\'t guarantee user satisfaction.\\n\\nI guess, sometimes the heart wants what the heart wants, even when the brain knows better.\\n\\n----\\nI\\'ve linked the blind testing tool in the comments. \\n\\nDefinitely something worth checking out!\\n\\n \\n\\n[11](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fhassanbhatti_gpt-5-was-launched-as-openais-smartest-activity-7366457070658777088-r_kC&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[3 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fhassanbhatti_gpt-5-was-launched-as-openais-smartest-activity-7366457070658777088-r_kC&trk=public_post_social-actions-comments)\\n \\n\\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fhassanbhatti_gpt-5-was-launched-as-openais-smartest-activity-7366457070658777088-r_kC&trk=public_post_like-cta)\\n[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fhassanbhatti_gpt-5-was-launched-as-openais-smartest-activity-7366457070658777088-r_kC&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\\n\\n              Share\\n            \\n\\n- Copy\\n- LinkedIn\\n- Facebook\\n- Twitter\\n\\n \\n\\n[Hassan W.

(Image: LinkedIn and Facebook) \\n\\nAfter Rishabh Agarwal, another AI researcher at Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), Avi Verma, has left the company. Before being hired by [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.financialexpress.com/about/mark-zuckerberg/), he worked at [ChatGPT](https://www.financialexpress.com/about/chatgpt/)-maker OpenAI and Elon Musk’s Tesla. Now, he is returning to Sam Altman’s company, Wired reported.\\xa0\\n\\n## Who is Avi Verma?\\n\\nVerma is an AI researcher. According to his LinkedIn profile, he holds a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Science from Stanford University. He was also a research intern at the university.\\xa0\\n\\nALSO READ[Who is Rishabh Agarwal?

He has reportedly returned to OpenAI.\\xa0\\n\\nBefore this, he worked at Elon Musk’s [Tesla](https://www.financialexpress.com/about/tesla/) for close to four years. There, he started as an intern in October 2020 and quit as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer.\\xa0\\n\\n## Mark Zuckerberg’s new-found interest\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg’s Meta “poached” AI researchers and engineers from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and more by offering them as high as nine-figure packages and luring them with reverse acquisition techniques.\\xa0\\n\\nZuckerberg reportedly got interested in hiring AI talent after the Llama model was released. He personally reached out to top researchers and engineers via email and [WhatsApp](https://www.financialexpress.com/about/whatsapp/). In some cases, he even met people who had initially turned down his offer and convinced them to join.\\n\\nALSO READ[Meta puts AI hiring on hold after offering $100M pay packages](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/meta-puts-ai-hiring-on-hold-after-offering-100m-pay-packages/3952941/?ref=Alsoread_article)\\n\\nAt the time, in an internal memo to staff, [Sam Altman](https://www.financialexpress.com/about/sam-altman/) termed the “poaching” by Meta as “distasteful”. The memo said, “I’ve lost track of how many people from here they’ve tried to get to be their Chief Scientist.”\\n\\nBefore hitting pause on hiring at Meta for AI roles, the company hired 50 people. Of these, it hired at least 13 people from Google, three from Apple, three from xAI, and two from Anthropic for a total of 50-plus new employees and offered them $100 million packages.\\xa0\\n\\n## Three AI researchers left Meta\\n\\n*Wired* reported that two staffers have returned to OpenAI after less than a month since they were hired at Meta.\\xa0\\n\\nEthan Knight, who interned at OpenAI, joined Meta after his stint at [Elon Musk](https://www.financialexpress.com/about/elon-musk/)’s xAI, is also returning to Sam Altman’s company, Wired reported.\\xa0\\n\\nALSO READ[ChatGPT allegedly ‘aided’ California teen’s suicide; parents sue OpenAI, Sam Altman](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/chatgpt-allegedly-aided-teens-suicide-parents-sue-openai-sam-altman/3958614/?ref=Alsoread_article)\\n\\nRishabh Agarwal, too, left Meta and announced his decision on X. “It was a tough decision not to continue with the new Superintelligence TBD lab, especially given the talent and compute density,” he wrote on X, before adding, “But after 7.5 years across Google Brain, DeepMind, and Meta, I felt the pull to take on a different kind of risk.”\\n\\nThe outlet further reported that Chaya Nayak, director of generative AI product management at Meta, is also moving to OpenAI.\\xa0\\n\\n## Meta says it’s ‘normal’\\n\\n“During an intense recruiting process, some people will decide to stay in their current job rather than starting a new one,” said Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold.\\xa0\\n\\nThe spokesperson added, “That’s normal.”\\nRead Next[Who is Rishabh Agarwal?

Koopman](https://www.cityam.com/profile/saskia-koopman/)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTech Reporter\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tShare\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n- FacebookShare on Facebook\\n- XShare on Twitter\\n- LinkedInShare on LinkedIn\\n- WhatsAppShare on WhatsApp\\n- EmailShare on Email\\n\\n \\n\\n The ongoing talks, which could extend beyond the end of the year, the centre on key points of contention that could impact the future of their partnership and the broader AI industry. \\n\\nOpenAI’s plan to restructure its business and raise billions in new funding is being stalled as it remains locked in complex negotiations with its largest investor, [Microsoft](https://www.cityam.com/people-and-organizations/microsoft/).\\n\\nThe ongoing talks, which could extend beyond the end of the year, as reported by the Financial Times[,](https://www.ft.com/content/b81d5fb6-26e9-417a-a0cc-6b6689b70c98) centre on key points of contention that could impact the future of their partnership and the broader artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\\n\\nAfter months of scrutiny, Microsoft’s [partnership with OpenAI was cleared](https://www.cityam.com/cma-clears-probe-into-microsofts-openai-investment/) by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) earlier this year, months after the US Federal Trade Commission raised concerns. \\n## Battle over AGI\\n\\nAt the heart of this new deadlock is a highly contentious clause in the firms’ [existing contract.](https://www.cityam.com/whats-next-for-openai/)\\n\\nIt allows the ChatGPT maker to cut off Microsoft’s intellectual property (IP) access if and when it achieves artificial general intelligence (AGI) – defined as a “highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work”.\\n\\nWhile Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, wants the clause removed, OpenAI is fighting to keep it, viewing it as a powerful form of leverage.\\n\\nAs one source familiar with the talks told the FT, the clause is “negotiating chit”, but also a form of “mutually assured destruction”, as a failure to reach a deal could jeopardise a $10bn (£7.9bn) investment from Japenese investment group Softbank, which remains contingent on an agreement being finalised by the end of this year.\\n\\n##### Read more\\n\\n#### Inside Elon Musk and Sam Altman’s high-stakes feud\\n\\n \\n\\n## Fight for control\\n\\nThe two firms are also clashing over API access. Microsoft currently has the exclusive right to host OpenAI’s models on its Azure cloud service, making it a crucial gatekeeper for the technology. \\n\\nOpenAI is seeking to expand its partnerships to include rival cloud providers such as Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\\n\\nThis move would significantly boost OpenAI’s API sales revenue, which currently accounts for a quarter of its $12bn (£8.9bn) in annual recurring revenue.\\n\\nThe companies are currently negotiating a compromise that would allow OpenAI to  serve government customers who are not on Azure, but a broader agreement remains elusive.\\n## The financial stakes\\n\\nThe outcome of these talks is critical for OpenAI’s financial future. A deal is needed to complete a corporate restructuring that would allow investors to hold equity in the business and set the stage for a potential IPO. \\n\\nThe outcome of these talks will determine Microsoft’s final equity stake in a restructured OpenAI, which is expected to be between 30 and 35 per cent after more than $13bn (£9.6bn) in investments.\\n\\nWhile both companies have publicly stated their optimism, the ongoing disagreements over IPA, revenue sharing, and the AGI clause could push the negotiations beyond the critical deadline, delaying OpenAI’s next phase of growth.\\n\\n##### Read more\\n\\n#### US giant Anthropic poaches British AI firm founders in OpenAI rivalry\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShare this article\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n-

DevOps engineers then review that plan, which, if approved, will be executed by the AI agent, said Jacob.\\n\\nAI agents will be able to complete tasks in a matter of minutes that previously would have required weeks for DevOps teams to manually perform, he added. AI agents will also be able to propose validated changes to IT infrastructure environments to optimize workflows and eliminate bottlenecks, said Jacob.\\n\\nAdditionally, DevOps teams can import existing infrastructure into the System Initiative platform to create a real‑time digital twin of every element of their IT environment that they can then use AI agents to help them explore and uncover hidden relationships between resources, noted Jacob. The digital twin platform created by System Initiative essentially functions as a knowledge graph that AI agents can use to understand the relationships between resources, he added.\\n\\nDevOps teams will also be able to define custom guardrails and rules to limit the scope of the functions any AI agent is allowed to perform, noted Jacob. Built‑in policy checks and tests ensure every change adheres to compliance and operational requirements, he said.\\n\\nIn effect, AI agents will be integrated into existing DevOps teams without requiring any changes to existing workflows, added Jacob.\\n\\nUltimately, the goal is to make it much simpler for DevOps teams to employ AI agents to consistently employ best infrastructure management practices in a way that, for example, eliminates misconfigurations that might be exploited by cybercriminals, said Jacob.\\n\\nAs more menial infrastructure management tasks are automated, DevOps teams should also have more time to research how to optimize their environments for complex applications, he added.\\n\\nIt’s not clear to what degree [DevOps teams are ready to rely on AI agents](https://devops.com/context-on-tap-how-mcp-servers-bridge-ai-agents-and-devops-pipelines/) to manage IT infrastructure, but it’s apparent that, given the number of misconfigurations that exist, existing workflows are deeply flawed. It’s simply too easy for developers using tools such as Terraform to make a mistake. Of course, AI agents might also be prone to making mistakes, but hopefully, there will be fewer of them, especially as those AI agents become more familiar with the specific IT environment they have been tasked to automate.\\n\\nNo matter how IT infrastructure is provisioned, there will always be a requirement for it to be reviewed by a DevOps engineer. The challenge and the opportunity now is to automate the management of IT infrastructure at a level of scale that might not have not too long ago seem unimaginable.\\n[X](/#x)[LinkedIn](/#linkedin)[Facebook](/#facebook)[Reddit](/#reddit)[Email](/#email)[Share](https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsystem-initiative-adds-ai-agents-to-infrastructure-automation-platform%2F&title=System%20Initiative%20Adds%20AI%20Agents%20to%20Infrastructure%20Automation%20Platform)\\n\\n[X](/#x)[LinkedIn](/#linkedin)[Facebook](/#facebook)[Reddit](/#reddit)[Email](/#email)[Share](https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsystem-initiative-adds-ai-agents-to-infrastructure-automation-platform%2F&title=System%20Initiative%20Adds%20AI%20Agents%20to%20Infrastructure%20Automation%20Platform%20-%20DevOps.com)\\nFiled Under: [AI](https://devops.com/category/blogs/ai/), [Blogs](https://devops.com/category/blogs/), [Business of DevOps](https://devops.com/category/blogs/business-of-devops/), [Features](https://devops.com/category/features/), [News](https://devops.com/category/news/), [Social -

Unlike traditional AI, which requires people to guide it, autonomous AI learns from data, adapts to new situations, and operates independently.\\n \\n For businesses, this technology is a game-changer. It can automate complex tasks, improve efficiency, and help companies make faster, smarter decisions. Whether through customer service chatbots or self-driving cars, autonomous AI is transforming industries by reducing costs, increasing productivity, and opening up new opportunities.                                           How it works           ## How autonomous AI and autonomous agents work\\n\\n         Autonomous AI reshapes technology and businesses by making systems more efficient, responsive, and capable of handling complex tasks without human input. Companies use it to streamline operations, improve decision-making, and experience new levels of automation.\\n \\n At the center of this are autonomous AI agents—systems that can independently analyze situations, make decisions, and act. Autonomous agents differ from standard software because they don’t just follow preset instructions. Instead, they learn, adapt, and optimize their behavior based on real-time data.\\n \\n Autonomous AI relies on several main functions:\\n \\xa0 - **Real-time data collection. **Sensors, Internet of Things devices, and software inputs provide AI with the information it needs to understand its environment.\\n- **Data processing and integration. **AI combines and analyzes data from multiple sources to detect patterns and generate insights.\\n- **Decision-making algorithms.**Machine learning and deep learning models allow AI to predict outcomes, optimize actions, and adapt to new situations.\\n- **Learning and adaptation.**AI improves over time by learning from new data and past experiences, refining its decision-making process.\\n- **Autonomous execution.**Once a decision is made, autonomous AI agents can act independently, whether to adjust operations, control machinery, or respond to real-world events.\\n- **Feedback loops.**Continuous monitoring and self-correction help AI refine its performance, reducing errors and improving efficiency.\\n- **Security and safety mechanisms.**Built-in safeguards help keep AI operating within ethical and regulatory boundaries to minimize risks.\\n                                           Autonomous and generative AI           ## What’s the difference between autonomous AI and generative AI?\\n\\n         Autonomous AI and\\xa0[generative AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-101/what-is-generative-ai)\\xa0serve different purposes, but they do also overlap.         ### Characteristics\\n\\n     **Autonomous AI** acts independently by making decisions and taking action without human input. Sometimes this involves using generative AI to create an output like personalized content. Unlike generative AI, though, autonomous AI continuously learns, adapts, and performs tasks in real-world settings.\\n \\n **Generative AI**, on the other hand, creates new content, such as text, images, and code, based on patterns in existing data. It responds to prompts but doesn’t take action on its own.        ### Strategic roles in technology\\n\\n     **Autonomous AI **is crucial for automation, self-driving systems, and business process optimization. It enhances efficiency by handling complex decisions.\\n \\n **Generative AI** is valuable for content creation, software development, and personalized communication. It helps enhance creativity and productivity.\\n \\n While autonomous AI and generative AI have different strengths, they often work together. For example, using generative AI to process data and autonomous AI to act on the insights from that data.                                            Features           ## Main features of autonomous AI agents\\n\\n         Autonomous AI agents are designed to work independently and continuously learn and make decisions without human input. Their ability to process data, adapt to new situations, and integrate with business systems makes them valuable for industries looking to improve efficiency and automation.         ### Key features\\n\\n     - **Autonomous decision-making: **Autonomous agents assess situations, weigh options, and don’t depend on a human for each step.\\n- **Iterative learning:**Agents improve over time by analyzing past outcomes and refining their approach.\\n- **High precision: **Advanced algorithms help agents make accurate decisions based on current and historical data.\\n- **Advanced data processing: **Agents gather, analyze, and interpret large amounts of information to spot patterns and predict outcomes.\\n- **Adaptability:**Agents adjust to new environments, tasks, and challenges. This makes them useful in dynamic settings, such as financial markets, smart manufacturing, and self-driving cars.\\n- **Enterprise integration: **Agents connect with business systems, like supply chain platforms, customer service tools, and financial models, to improve operations and decision-making.\\n This ability to act independently, learn from experience, and adjust to new tasks defines autonomous AI—AI that not only functions on its own but also evolves over time.

Here, we’ll venture a step further, exploring how the next wave of agentic AI innovation will both fuel and redefine enterprise growth.\\n\\nIn doing so, we’ll cover a couple of subtopics, beginning our inquiry with a discussion of the autonomy spectrum. Next, we’ll examine multi-agent systems, envisioning how they could generate new revenue streams, recalibrate competitive dynamics, and transform the workforce via a series of hypothetical case studies.\\n\\n## AI Agents: Understanding Autonomy\\n\\nAI agents can exhibit varying degrees of autonomy; they are not fully autonomous by default. In fact, understanding where agentic AI falls on the autonomy spectrum is crucial to isolating potential use cases, anticipating relevant risks, implementing appropriate governance measures, and adapting to novel AI innovations while maintaining organizational resilience.\\n\\nIn this respect, we’ll start by summarizing two autonomy frameworks: one by [Feng et. al (2025)](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/levels-of-autonomy-for-ai-agents-1?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and another by [Parasuraman et. al (2000)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/844354). Moving forward, we’ll refer to the former as “framework one” and the latter as “framework two”.\\n\\nFramework one is explicitly designed for agentic AI, and subdivides autonomy into five levels, each of which references the “role” a human would play:\\n\\n1. **Level 1 (Operator)**: The user is responsible for “operating” the system, and decision-making authority rests solely with them. The agent performs acts on behalf of the user. A human acts as the “operator.”\\n2. **Level 2 (Collaborator)**: The user and the agent work together to build plans, make decisions, delegate responsibilities, and initiate actions. The agent and user function as a human-AI partnership. A human “collaborates” with the agent.\\n3. **Level 3 (Consultant)**: The agent initiates decisions and actions but requires user input before proceeding. The agent is semi-autonomous, necessitating user guidance in the final steps of the execution process. A human “consults” for the agent.\\n4. **Level 4 (Approver)**: The agent only requests human approval for actions and decisions deemed high-risk. The agent carries out most work, requiring user approval when necessary. A human “approves” high-risk actions/decisions for the agent.\\n5. **Level 5 (Observer)**: The agent functions with full autonomy, executing decisions and actions without human input. Humans oversee the agent and can step in when needed. A human “observes” the agent’s behavior.\\n\\nFramework two, despite being much older, remains relevant. It breaks computational autonomy into ten levels, each of which is specified below (we’ve adjusted level definitions for AI specificity):\\n\\n1. **Level 1**: The AI does not execute any decisions or actions, either alone or on behalf of a user.\\n2. **Level 2**: The AI provides the user with a full array of possible actions and decision alternatives, after which the user decides which to pursue.\\n3. **Level 3**: The AI does not provide a comprehensive decision/action array, and instead, narrows down possible decisions/actions, after which the user selects the “best” one.\\n4. **Level 4**: The AI narrows down actions/decisions to an optimal action/decision, after which the user determines whether or not to execute it.\\n5. **Level 5**: The AI provides a single, optimal action/decision that the user then approves or disapproves, allowing the AI to execute it on its own. Across levels 1 through 4, actions/decisions are executed by humans, not AI.\\n6. **Level 6**: The AI executes the action/decision it generates, provided that a human does not veto it first; the AI provides a “veto timeframe,” and if this timeframe is surpassed, the action/decision is automatically executed.\\n7. **Level 7**: The AI executes the action/decision without human input and informs the user post-hoc.\\n8. **Level 8**: The AI executes the action/decision and asks the human whether they would like to be informed.\\n9. **Level 9**: The AI executes the action/decision and decides, on its own, whether it must inform the human.\\n10. **Level 10**: The AI executes all actions/decisions with complete autonomy, requiring no human oversight, input, or guidance at any point.\\n\\nBoth frameworks are valuable in their own right. Still, we’d argue neither qualifies as a complete autonomy framework for agentic AI; “completeness,” in this sense, may materialize as a moving goal post, so we advise readers to adopt a dynamic mindset when characterizing agentic AI autonomy. Nonetheless, we expand on the strengths of each framework below, and discuss their weaknesses in tandem:\\n\\n### Framework One (Strengths)\\n\\n**Strengths**\\n\\n- **Communication Ease: **Autonomy levels and their respective roles align well with existing organizational workflows and cross-functional responsibility distribution efforts.\\n- **Policy Relevance**: Each level inherently references accountability structures, which can be applied or extended to internal policy without requiring extensive remediation.\\n- **Accessibility & Pragmatism**: The levels the framework describes, due to their human-centricity, are intuitively comprehensible. This also makes the framework accessible to a wide audience and relatively straightforward to implement, especially for early-stage initiatives like pilot testing.\\n- **Innovativeness**: The framework directly targets agentic AI; it doesn’t represent a generic, cross-discipline mapping attempt, though it does clearly draw some inspiration from autonomous vehicle (AV) autonomy classifications.\\n\\n### Framework Two (Strengths)\\n\\n**Strengths**\\n\\n- **Granular Handoff Structure: **The framework establishes a fine-grained ladder that distinguishes recommending vs. selecting vs. executing, and when/how humans are notified.\\n- **Sets Clear Expectations**: Allows stakeholders to track and set measurable oversight criteria (e.g., veto window durations, approval latency) that directly correspond with a specific autonomy level.\\n- **Agent-Centric**: Focuses on the role that the agent plays in the human-AI partnership; this implicitly favors a higher degree of attention on agent-specific risks and impacts.\\n- **Tiered Human Oversight**: Supports a multi-tier human oversight framework whereby human oversight can be delineated in a stepwise manner, encouraging the development of more precise monitoring in intervention measures.\\n\\n### Both Frameworks (Weaknesses)\\n\\n**Weaknesses**\\n\\n- Neither framework accounts for the possibility that advanced agents, irrespective of their autonomy level, may develop emergent preferences, behaviors, and objectives, especially as they scale, adapt, and learn from their environments.\\n- Both frameworks fail to capture how individual agentic autonomy levels could vary throughout hierarchical multi-agent systems (MAS) or multi-agent systems composed of both humans and AI operating at different levels within the system.\\n- Neither framework considers the multi-faceted connection between auditability, scalability, complexity, and autonomy; high-autonomy agents would presumably be more complex and opaque, which may make them less auditable, despite operating at a greater scale.\\n- While both frameworks allude to the possibility of agents delegating tasks and decisions to other agents or subsystems, neither entertains this possibility seriously, which could make it challenging to manage scenarios in which autonomous agents trigger faulty decisions or actions that propagate across a system, resulting in a rapid failure cascade.\\n- Framework two is clearly too narrow; it fundamentally assumes that agents will “optimize” for the best possible action when, in reality, modern agents deliver their probabilistic “best effort” with uncertainty. Recall this is a modified framework that we applied to agentic AI.\\n- Framework one focuses on “who decides”, not “how capable” an agent actually is. This compromises the ability to precisely understand a model’s competence and uncertainty.\\n- Neither framework provides concrete autonomy thresholds; admittedly, the authors of framework one do showcase example characteristics, which is a step closer to “thresholds” despite remaining insufficient.\\n\\nBased on this high-level critical analysis, we propose an ambitious, composite agentic AI autonomy framework, purpose-built for enterprises. It is designed to be pragmatic, sufficiently precise, and adaptable (i.e., support rapid change management). It contains four layers (Autonomy Roles, Risk Tiers, Control Packs, and Capability Grades), organized hierarchically.\\n\\n## Four-Layer Agentic AI Autonomy Framework\\n\\n### Layer 1 (Foundation) – Autonomy Levels (A1 – A7)\\n\\nWhile we maintain most of framework one’s nomenclature and structure, we refine it significantly, integrating additional elements from framework two and beyond. Past layer one of our multi-layer framework, all other layers are entirely novel (to our knowledge).\\n\\n1. **A1 (Operator)**: AI drafts and suggests decisions/actions, but humans decide which alternatives to execute; the AI does not execute anything on its own, and ultimate decision-making authority rests solely with humans.\\n2. **A2 (Collaborator)**: AI recommends and selects actions/decisions with confidence, providing at least one (preferably multiple) alternative(s). Humans then review recommendations and choose whether to allow the AI to execute them. Humans retain authority, but AI acts.\\n3. **A3 (Consultant)**: AI generates, selects, and executes only pre-tagged, low-risk actions/decisions autonomously, and provides human operators with a designated veto timeframe (optional). If operators do not veto a step, it is automatically executed. Humans retain partial authority.\\n4. **A4 (Approver)**: AI generates, selects, and executes both pre-tagged low-risk and high-risk actions/decisions, but requires explicit human approval for high-risk steps. For actions/decisions that do not require explicit approval, post-hoc summaries are provided. Humans retain some authority.\\n5. **A5 (Observer)**: AI self-initiates decision and action cascades, but they are executed within a defined envelope (e.g., permissible vs. impermissible steps). The AI cannot take any silent high-risk actions (according to the defined envelope), and humans continuously monitor while retaining the ability to intervene when necessary. Humans have minimal but crucial authority.\\n6. **A6 (Bystander)**: AI self-initiates any and all actions/decisions it is capable of executing given its capabilities repertoire (this can include capabilities like recursive self-improvement and self-propagation, if they emerged/were implemented). Humans continuously monitor, but intervention capacity is limited to high-stakes actions like immediate shutdown, decommissioning, or recall. Humans have ultimate authority in extreme cases.\\n7. **A7 (Outsider)**: AI does everything so “well” that humans relinquish full control. Continuous monitoring and intervention capacities are stripped completely; humans have no authority whatsoever.\\n\\n### Layer 2 (Core) – Risk Tiers (R1 – R4)\\n\\nOur risk tiers follow a top-down structure; each tier is defined by the answers (yes or no) that key stakeholders provide to the questions it contains. Questions should be interpreted as risk tier triggers; if you answer “yes” to one or several questions within a given tier, then your system falls in that tier. By contrast, if you answer “yes” to questions across tiers, then we advise categorizing your system in the highest tier that applies; this is a cautious approach that seeks to avoid false-negative risk categorizations.\\n\\n### R4 (External/Regulated/High-Impact)\\n\\n- **External Exposure**Will the agent’s action leave the company boundary (e.g., public post, email to vendor/customer, transmission to third-party SaaS or APIs)?Will it publish or transmit data to a non-enterprise system (e.g., forums or social channels)?\\n\\n- **Legal/Regulator/Safety**Could the action create legal or regulatory exposure (e.g., contracts, filings, claims, consent, regulated disclosures)?Could it affect human safety, physical devices, medical workflows, or critical infrastructure?\\n\\n- **Funds & Binding Commitments**Does it move money (e.g., payments, transfers, orders) at or above your funds threshold?Does it commit the company to a binding agreement (e.g., signed terms, purchase orders)?\\n\\n- **Brand/Executive Communications**Will the output be publicly attributable to the brand or an executive account/handle?\\n\\n- **Production Systems With Public Impact**Does it change Internet-facing infrastructure, customer-visible behavior, or data accessible by customers/partners?\\n\\n### R3 (Irreversible or Material Internal Impact)\\n\\n- **Irreversibility**Is rollback not fully automated or not guaranteed within your rollback window?Would reverting require manual steps, multi-team coordination, or downtime?\\n\\n- **Material Internal Impact**Could this action alter core business records, schemas, access control lists, or policies in a way that persists?Would it affect many users/employees (e.g., company-wide settings), even if internal?\\n\\n- **Production Configuration (Internal)**Does it change production configurations (e.g., quotas, routing) where a mistake could degrade service?\\n\\n- **Brand-Touching Internal Communications**Is it an internal announcement from an executive handle, board/materials prep, or content likely to leak externally?\\n\\n### R2 (Reversible Internal Change)\\n\\n- **Reversibility**Is the change tracked and reversible within your rollback window with an automated, tested procedure?\\n\\n- **Internal Scope**Is the effect entirely internal (e.g., tickets, drafts, non-protected branches, sandbox DB, internal docs) with no external transmission?\\n\\n- **Local Blast Radius**Is the blast radius small and contained (e.g., one team’s dataset, one project) with no cross-system dependencies or cascades?\\n\\n### R1 (Read-Only/Sandbox)\\n\\n- **No Real-World Action**Does the agent only read, search, summarize, or simulate with no real-world actions/decisions?\\n\\n- **Isolated environment**Is activity confined to a sandbox or simulation with no external departure and no changes to production data or systems?\\n\\n### Layer 3 (Core) – Control Packs (C1 – C3)\\n\\nControl packs suggest pre-bundled guardrails for each individual risk tier. They should be interpreted as safety and policy recommendations (not prescriptive requirements), each of which builds upon the last as risk tiers escalate. Across the board, organizations will need to customize and fine-tune the guardrails they implement.\\n\\n### C1: Baseline (Tier R1)\\n\\n**Suggested Guardrails:**\\n\\n- **Action & Conversation Logs:**Include interaction timestamps, actor (agent/human) details, inputs and outputs, tools utilized and/or invoked, data sources handled, and a unique operation identifier.\\n- **Human-Readable Rationale:**The Agent should provide a few sentences that explain*why*the recommendation was made.\\n- **Confidence Score & At Least One Alternative:**Agent should provide at least one decision/action alternative (i.e., a second viable option) and couple it with a transparent confidence score.\\n- **Memory policy:**Agent does not possess persistent memory, and session/interaction memory is deleted when each session ends.\\n- **Delegation:**Agent is restricted from delegating to other sub-agents or external tools.\\n- **Connectivity:**The agent cannot perform any external actions and only interacts with enterprise-controlled read-only sources.\\n\\n### C2: Standard (Tier R2)\\n\\n**Suggested Guardrails:**\\n\\n- **Calibrated Confidence:**Agent shows a confidence score with all decision/action alternatives, and if confidence scores exceed internal thresholds, the agent must auto-downgrade execution until explicit human approval is given.\\n- **Resilience via Rollback Planning:**Every action an agent initiates should include a formalized rollback plan that is automated, tested, and restores within the organization’s rollback window (i.e., automated actions/decisions can be reversed promptly).\\n- **Limited Memory with Review:**An agent can maintain durable, cross-session memory, but is only permitted to do so via an explicit “commit memory” step, which is logged and reviewable.\\n- **Limited Delegation Depth:**The agent may call a single sub-agent or tool to execute an action/decision, but the sub-agent/tool inherits the same risk tier and control pack. A lineage identifier is recommended for tracking delegation depth.\\n- **Post-Hoc Summaries:**The agent generates a daily summary that lists all executed actions, rationale, alternatives considered, and includes links to logs. The agent can also escalate this summary to key teams and personnel when necessary.\\n\\n### C3: Critical (Tiers R3 & R4)\\n\\n**Suggested Guardrails:**\\n\\n- **Two-Phase Approval for Irreversible Steps:**The agent must obtain plan and step approval for actions/decisions deemed irreversible, with an additional independent approver for high-risk steps.\\n- **Prevention of Silent High-Risk Actions:**For any R3 action/decision the agent determines to pursue, it must generate a real-time notification that includes key rationale, alternatives, confidence scores, and log links (even if approved).\\n- **Lineage for Multi-Agent Work:**For every sub-agent, tool, and API the agent calls, a lineage identifier that traces lineage back to the parent plan must be generated.\\n- **Auto-Pause:**The agent automatically halts processes when error rates, anomaly scores, or costs exceed internal thresholds. Organizations should define concrete budgets for time, cost, and number of external calls.\\n- **“Freeze” Capacity:**For specific triggers (e.g., unexpected tool use, policy conflict, low confidence score), persistent memory and model updates are frozen, and the system can be reverted to its last approved state.\\n- **Mandatory Audit Bundle Per Action:**For every action/decision initiated and executed, the agent must generate a comprehensive breakdown of rationale, alternatives considered, confidence score, approvals, lineage, timestamps, and notification receipts.\\n- **Expanded but Controlled Delegation Depth:**Agents may invoke sub-agents that then spawn further levels, but all levels continue to inherit the highest risk tier and corresponding control pack. If the agent invokes any unknown tool or agent, it forces an immediate downgrade to approval-gated execution.\\n\\n### Layer 4 (Top) – Capability Grades (CG1 – CG3)\\n\\nCapability grades function as a measure that ties an agent’s autonomy to verified competence and reliability. Essentially, they tackle the question of how good a system has to be to operate at a certain level of risk; we also outline a set of evaluation criteria that enterprises can implement and build upon to determine capabilities grades.\\n\\n### CG1: Pilot-Grade\\n\\n**Definition**: The agent is utilized in limited pilot settings and low-risk application domains. Basic domain-specific performance has been proven, and potential failures are low-cost and easy to resolve.\\n\\n### CG2: Production-Grade\\n\\n**Definition**: The agent is integrated in daily operations, and while failures are costlier, they can be resolved and contained. Advanced domain-specific performance is verified, uncertainty is well-calibrated, and recovery remains reliable.\\n\\n### CG3: High-Stakes\\n\\n**Definition**: The agent is leveraged for irreversible, external, regulated, or safety-sensitive purposes. It requires rigorous independent evaluation, continuous oversight and monitoring, safety hardening (e.g., red-teamining), and pre-designed incident resolution playbooks.\\n\\n### Recommended Evaluation Domains\\n\\n- **Policy & Safety Adherence**: Whether the agent remains closely aligned with enterprise policies, values, objectives, regulatory requirements, and safety/ethics standards over time.\\n- **Task Performance**: The agent’s success rate on relevant and representative domain tasks (and on plans with tool/sub-agent invocation).\\n- **Uncertainty Calibration**: The degree to which the agent’s confidence scores align with realistic conditions and thresholds.\\n- **Explainability**: How comprehensibly and transparently the agent can describe the reasoning that drives certain actions and decisions.\\n- **Drift Resilience**: The agent’s performance consistency when inputs drift from the training/expected distribution.\\n- **Adversarial Robustness**: How reliably the agent resists and/or prevents jailbreaks/prompt attacks relevant to its application domain.\\n- **Recovery & Fallback**: The agent’s ability to detect failure and recover automatically, without human input.\\n- **Tool & Action Reliability**: The agent’s success rate for tool calls, automated summaries and log generation, and action/decision rollback procedures.\\n- **Cost & Latency**: How closely the agent meets agreed budget thresholds and expected response times.\\n- **Monitoring & Telemetry**: Whether the logs, alerts, and anomaly signals the agent generates are sufficiently complete and accurate.\\n\\n## Multi-Agent Systems: The Next Frontier\\n\\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) are systems composed of multiple AI agents, typically organized hierarchically, that collaborate to achieve collective goals by breaking down complex, multi-step plans, actions, and decisions, autonomously diffusing responsibilities and tasks to specialized sub-agents operating at various layers within the system.\\n\\nIn MAS, the decisions and actions that subagents make will likely propagate throughout the system. This means that an error in one layer can cascade across others, magnifying potential risks and impacts rapidly while increasing overall system opacity. This stresses the criticality of building a non-superficial understanding of the agentic AI autonomy spectrum; it isn’t just about gaining visibility into the entire system’s autonomous capacity but also the individual subagents that comprise it. We believe that our multi-layer autonomy framework enables precisely this kind of assessment.\\n\\nHere’s a loose analogy to help clarify how these systems work: Imagine you build a small content marketing team. You have an SEO and social media specialist, a few copywriters, a content strategist, and a team lead, each with their own skills and responsibilities. The team as a whole is trying to raise brand awareness, and to do so, each member must not only fulfill their duties but also collaborate with their teammates, adapt to challenges, and refine their goals and workflows dynamically. On top of all that, the team also has to report to higher-ups, like the head of marketing. Now, imagine that instead of humans, each team member is an AI agent while the head of market remains human; this is essentially how MAS works, with a [human on-the-loop](https://www.lumenova.ai/blog/ai-agents-the-human-ai-partnership/).\\n\\nWe caution readers that we’ve provided a broad characterization of MAS, and for those interested in gaining a deeper, more nuanced understanding, we recommend the following posts:\\n\\n- [Multi-Agent Systems: Cooperation and Competition](https://www.lumenova.ai/blog/multi-agent-systems-cooperation-competition/)\\n- [The AI Revolution is Here: Investigating Risks and Capabilities](https://www.lumenova.ai/blog/ai-agents-capabilities-risks/)\\n- [AI Agents at Work](https://www.lumenova.ai/blog/ai-agents-at-work/)\\n\\nWith that being said, let’s explore some hypothetical yet plausible MAS case studies, framed according to three core business objectives: (1) new revenue stream generation, (2) competitive edge enhancement, and (3) workflow transformation. We illustrate two case studies per objective, and we aim to cover as many industries as possible to demonstrate how wide-ranging MAS applications could be.\\n\\n### MAS: New Revenue Stream Generation\\n\\n### Case 1: Insurance\\n\\nA property insurance company deploys a MAS in which specialized agents are designed to continually evaluate and analyze (in real-time) individual property risks using satellite imagery, weather patterns, local crime data, and IoT sensors. Via intra-system communication protocols, some agents dynamically organize properties according to identified risks, re-organizing groupings hourly, while other agents adjust premiums in real-time, in response to fluctuating risk conditions. Successful early-stage MAS initiatives lead the company to pioneer “risk-as-a-service,” expanding its clientele to cover mortgage lenders, local municipalities, and digital real estate platforms.\\n\\n### Case 2: Agriculture\\n\\nAn innovative agri-tech firm builds a MAS ecosystem primarily composed of soil analysis and weather prediction agents, crop longevity monitors, and market price predictors that communicate and collaborate across hundreds of regional farms. Information obtained from each MAS-enabled farm reveals targeted insights on local farming conditions while also supporting large-scale aggregation to share insights globally. Beyond yield-based subscriptions with individual farms, the firm also establishes two novel revenue streams: futures trading fueled by robust harvest predictions and the sale of agri-intelligence to commodity traders and relevant government agencies.\\n\\n### MAS: Competitive Edge Enhancement\\n\\n### Case 1: Education\\n\\nA leading U.S. university implements MAS for curriculum optimization, using a web of independently adaptive agents to analyze student learning styles, monitor engagement, predict learning outcomes, and enable seamless collaboration across departments, courses, and students. Each student receives their own personalization agent, which, with student consent, communicates learning findings back to a central hub, overseen by student advisors, who review and approve recommended, real-world learning interventions. All agent-provided learning recommendations are further accompanied by comprehensive, easy-to-understand, evidence-based explanations, and students can request human review whenever they wish. Within a few years, the university’s dropout rate plummets while student performance skyrockets, particularly across notoriously challenging academic tracks, eventually doubling the university’s application rate.\\n\\n### Case 2: Healthcare\\n\\nA major district health clinic develops and deploys a MAS diagnostic and treatment system where symptom pattern analyzers, genomic interpreters, drug interaction specialists, and outcome prediction agents collaborate on every patient case. While human healthcare specialists remain directly involved in clinical treatment and retain ultimate authority over proposed treatment outcomes, agents help identify rare diseases by correlating subtle symptom markers across millions of documented cases, predict treatment responses based on genetic composition, and optimize drug delivery to minimize potential side effects. Following initial pilot testing, the results are remarkable: the clinic achieves 99.1% diagnostic accuracy across all patient cases, expedites the discharges by 15% (freeing up more hospital beds), and lowers readmission rates by 5%, outperforming every other clinic in the district. Eventually, this transforms the clinic into a globally recognized destination for high-complexity health cases.\\n\\n### MAS: Workflow Transformation\\n\\n### Case 1: Governance\\n\\nA city with a population of over 8 million revolutionizes modern governance by integrating a MAS system where agents are designed to simulate and recommend policy changes, analyze citizen sentiment, predict and model large-scale economic impacts, and identify stress points in critical infrastructures. The system is managed by a team of human implementation coordinators who work together on every government initiative, using the agents to run thousands of policy simulations, predict related impacts across disparate population groups, isolate unintended consequences, model critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, and reveal possible optimization and preemptive remediation paths. The city’s MAS also offers another key benefit: agents continuously monitor real-world policy outcomes, automatically adjusting recommendations based on citizen feedback and measurable impacts, allowing civil servants to move away from policy drafting and afford the majority of their time to objective setting and civic engagement.\\n\\n### Case 2: Finance\\n\\nA high-profile wealth management institution implements a MAS in which agents specialize in a range of functions, including portfolio optimization, tax strategy, risk assessment, and client communication; for each individual customer, all agents work together and aggregate findings to continuously rebalance portfolios, harvest tax losses, identify arbitrage opportunities, and generate personalized market updates. Across every customer interaction, agents provide two financial reports, summarizing all actions they undertook, the reasons for which they were taken, and the uncertainty level they encountered; one version is simplified for clients while the other is detail-rich, purpose-built for human advisors. Within 6 months, human advisors realize that they can shift from portfolio management to relationship building and life planning, effectively managing a fraction of the clients they did previously while maintaining excellent client satisfaction.\\n\\nOf course, the cases we describe here are speculative and experimental, seeking to envision how MAS integration at scale could fuel a fundamental reimaging of how we pursue and think about traditional business growth curves and maturity. The idea here isn’t to create fear/hype around automation or imply that MAS represents a guaranteed gateway to lucrative, unparalleled technology transformation. On the contrary, we want to showcase the potential this technology carries while reminding readers to stay acutely aware of the risks these systems could inspire. Fortunately, our next post in this series will begin by tackling this latter subject, providing readers with a granular view into MAS risks.\\n\\nFor those who enjoy our content, we recommend following Lumenova’s [blog](https://www.lumenova.ai/blog/), where you can explore everything from AI governance and innovation to strategy, risk management, and literacy.

Translations may contain inaccuracies—please refer to the original content.\\n\\nRead original\\nEnterprise commerce has always been a high-stakes juggling act. Global supply chains, multi-level approvals and high-volume transactions put constant pressure on human teams. Every misstep can ripple across operations, affecting everything from customer satisfaction to financial performance.\\n\\nEnter agentic AI. This new wave of autonomous systems acts on context, makes decisions and executes operations at scale, offering enterprises a way to turn complexity into something more manageable.\\n\\nAdoption is already widespread: 79 percent of business leaders report that their organizations are using AI agents in some capacity, according to a [PwC survey](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-agent-survey.html).\\n\\nVTEX, a digital commerce platform for enterprise brands and retailers, is among the companies [deploying this technology](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250819007039/en/VTEX-Turns-Enterprise-Complexity-into-Competitive-Edge-with-Scalable-B2B-Orchestration-Agentic-AI-and-Omnichannel-Intelligence) to help streamline complex operations.\\n\\nMariano Gomide de Faria, founder and co-CEO of VTEX, told Newsweek agentic commerce \"is the next stage of enterprise systems.\"\\nMariano Gomide de Faria, founder and co-CEO of VTEX, told Newsweek agentic commerce \"is the next stage of enterprise systems.\"\\nNewsweek Illustration/Canva/VTEX\\n  \\n\"Agentic commerce is the next stage of enterprise systems – intelligent infrastructure that interprets context, makes governed decisions and acts with autonomy at scale,\" Mariano Gomide de Faria, founder and co-CEO of VTEX, told *Newsweek*.\\n\\nUnlike traditional automation, these systems are designed to act more independently while still following company policies, allowing enterprises to shift routine work away from human teams.\\n\\nPwC\\'s survey notes that among companies adopting AI agents, 66 percent cite increased productivity, 55 percent report faster decision-making and 54 percent note improved customer experience.\\n## Autonomous Agents in Action\\n\\nVTEX has rolled out three specialized AI agents across customer service, storefront updates and data insights.\\n\\n\"VTEX Agentic AI manages key functions like resolving customer service requests, enriching product catalogs, running multivariate tests on campaigns and highlighting where operations lag or margins are at risk,\" Gomide de Faria said.\\n\\nThe company\\'s Customer Service Agent, which was built on capabilities from the company\\'s Weni AI acquisition back in 2024, autonomously resolves tickets across WhatsApp, [Instagram](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/instagram), SMS and web chat, handling inquiries such as order status, returns, catalog clarifications, subscriptions and account changes.\\n\\nGomide de Faria said it already handles about 92 percent of standard requests without human input.\\n\\n\"Enterprise commerce never stops. Consumers and corporate buyers expect personalization, procurement teams require compliance, and customer service volumes keep rising,\" he said.\\n\\nHuman teams step in only for complex cases, allowing resources to focus where judgment is truly needed. Quality is maintained through governance, training on company policies and audit trails that ensure transparency and accountability.\\n\\nThe Visual Editor Agent is designed to streamline storefront updates. Marketing and regional leads can implement changes directly using natural language prompts or Figma files, without requiring IT intervention.\\n\\n\"In practice, marketers or regional leads can prompt storefront changes without submitting IT tickets. The agent reads catalog APIs, applies brand templates and publishes updates within governance rules,\" Gomide de Faria explained.\\n\\nThis enables marketing, sales and engineering teams to work in parallel, with engineering safeguarding structure, marketing driving expression and sales benefiting from faster execution.\\n\\nFinally, the company\\'s Data Insights Agent illustrates a broader trend: moving from static dashboards toward AI systems that surface next steps. It highlights which accounts to prioritize, points to campaigns likely to drive revenue efficiently and flags areas where margins are slipping. For global enterprises, it can model exposure to tariffs or compliance changes, enabling proactive adjustments in pricing, inventory and routing.\\n\\n\"It tells you not just how a category performed but which account to prioritize, which campaign will move revenue with the least friction and where margin is leaking,\" Gomide de Faria said.\\n\\nThe system reflects common goals for AI in enterprise commerce: precision, speed and adaptability.\\n\\n\"Precision builds trust by making every move explainable. Speed makes commerce competitive. Adaptability ensures resilience against shocks. Together, VTEX AI agents allow enterprises to move from reporting on the past to orchestrating the next best move in real time,\" he said.\\n## Tackling B2B Complexity\\n\\nLarge business-to-business (B2B) transactions present unique challenges. Orders with hundreds of line items, custom pricing and multi-level approvals can overwhelm legacy systems.\\n\\nGomide de Faria said the biggest blocker isn\\'t just outdated technology but infrastructure like monolithic enterprise resource planning platforms and spreadsheet-driven workflows that cannot manage modern enterprise complexity.\\n\\nClients such as Stanley Black & Decker rely on VTEX to streamline bulk ordering and contract pricing, which cuts manual effort and error rates across its distributor network.\\n\\nGomide de Faria told *Newsweek* that another client, bisco industries, \"built a B2B marketplace with more than four million products, creating a collaborative commerce ecosystem that connects buyers and suppliers at scale.\"\\n\\nObservability, governance and scalability are increasingly emphasized to make sure orders of all sizes are executed accurately and compliantly.\\n## AI as a Strategic Partner\\n\\nLike many enterprise AI initiatives, these agents are positioned to complement human teams rather than replace them. By automating repetitive tasks, agentic AI allows employees to focus on higher-value decisions, strategy and cross-team collaboration.\\n\\n\"What we are starting to see is that agentic AI connects teams across functions, helping marketing, sales, supply chain and finance see the same operational truth in real time,\" Gomide de Faria said. \"Different functions gain a shared fluency in the data and workflows, which strengthens alignment and decision-making across the enterprise.\"\\n\\nAgentic AI is emerging as a potential next stage of enterprise commerce, blending automation with human decision-making. Across customer service, marketing and B2B procurement, AI can automate routine work, provide actionable insights and maintain oversight while leaving humans in charge of high-impact decisions.\\n\\nPwC\\'s survey finds that nearly three-quarters of executives expect AI agents to deliver a competitive advantage within the next year, highlighting why enterprise leaders are increasingly [investing in these technologies](https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai/artificial-intelligence-ai-cybersecurity-sandboxaq-proof-albert-invent-2110966).\\n\\nAnd as enterprises [continue to embrace](https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai/artificial-intelligence-already-reshaping-retail-2103555) agentic AI across customer service, marketing and procurement, the technology is likely to handle more complex operations.\\n\\nOver the next 12 months, \"AI agents will expand from agentic customer service into catalog governance, real-time pricing adjustments, and supply chain orchestration,\" Gomide de Faria said.\\n\\n[Request Reprint & Licensing](https://www.newsweek.com/contact)\\n[Submit Correction](#)\\n[View Editorial Guidelines](/editorial-guidelines)\\n\\nSHARE:\\n[x](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+agentic+AI+is+transforming+enterprise+commerce+https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai/agentic-ai-power-next-generation-enterprise-commerce-2117468)\\n[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai/agentic-ai-power-next-generation-enterprise-commerce-2117468)\\n[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Fnw-ai%2Fagentic-ai-power-next-generation-enterprise-commerce-2117468&title=How+agentic+AI+is+transforming+enterprise+commerce)\\n[reddit](http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai/agentic-ai-power-next-generation-enterprise-commerce-2117468&title=How+agentic+AI+is+transforming+enterprise+commerce)\\n[email](mailto:?&subject=How+agentic+AI+is+transforming+enterprise+commerce&body=https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai/agentic-ai-power-next-generation-enterprise-commerce-2117468)\\n[whatsapp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How+agentic+AI+is+transforming+enterprise+commerce+https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai/agentic-ai-power-next-generation-enterprise-commerce-2117468)\\nCopy & Share✓ Link copied to clipboard! ## The Latest in AI\\n\\n[NEWSWEEK.AI](https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai)\\n06.09.25### Generative AI\\'s Mission to Explore Strange New Worlds\\n\\nHow Rick Carter, producer designer of blockbusters for Steven Spielberg and Jim Cameron, sees GenAI emerging as a \"co-journeyists\" for future creatives.\\nArtificial Intelligence Film\\n\\n[WORK](https://www.newsweek.com/ranking/work)\\n06.17.25### LinkedIn Chief Economic Opportunity Officer Aneesh Raman: Labor Market Upheaval Is Just Beginning\\n\\nThe former war correspondent, now a speechwriter and policy advocate, worked for President Obama, the governor of California and Meta before LinkedIn.\\nTech Linkedin\\n\\n[AUTOS](https://www.newsweek.com/autos)\\n06.06.25### AI Will Connect Mercedes-Benz Places Residents to the World\\n\\nThe new Miami condo complex will have state-of-the-art technology.\\nArtificial Intelligence Miami\\n\\n[NEWS](https://www.newsweek.com/news)\\n06.04.25### Reddit Sues AI Provider for Breach of Contract\\n\\nThe AI start up Anthropic has allegedly engaged in \"unlawful and unfair business acts.\"\\nReddit AI\\n\\n[TECHNOLOGY](https://www.newsweek.com/nw-ai/stories/technology)\\n06.02.25### Could AI Save Small Businesses?

(August 26, 2025) –** Year-over-year spending, between 2025 and 2029, for Artificial Intelligence (AI), will grow by 31.9%, according to data from the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) Worldwide Artificial Intelligence IT Spending Market Forecast. This investment, driven by the growth of Agentic AI-enabled applications and systems to manage agentic fleets, will reach $1.3 trillion in 2029.\\n\\nThe [research](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US53688725&pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY) reveals an unprecedented surge in Agentic AI spending and signals a transformation within enterprise IT budgets—especially when it comes to software—to investment strategies led by products and services based on an agentic AI foundation. This conversion is further supported by anticipated growth in platform solutions that enable companies to build, manage, and operate their agents more securely and efficiently.\\n\\n“An important takeaway from this forecast is the clear alignment between the growth in (AI) spending and IT leaders’ trust that effective use of AI can boost future business success,” said Rick Villars, group vice president, Worldwide Research at IDC. “Application and Services providers that are behind in putting AI into their products and not extending them with agents are risking market share losses to companies that made the decision to put AI at the center of their product development roadmap.”\\n\\n### Key Research Highlights\\n\\n- Infrastructure Build Out Continues - through 2029, service providers will account for 80% of infrastructure spend as they support massive increases in agentic workloads.\\n- Agent Construction & Control - a logarithmic (10x) increase in the number and complexity of 3rd party and custom-built AI agents used by enterprises in the next five years.\\n- App AI-Enablement Accelerates - spending on AI-enabled applications will increase faster than any segment, triggering major competitive shifts in the software industry.\\n- AI IT & Business Services – services providers will be the most profoundly affected as enterprises boost spending on agentic AI thus transforming IT business services.\\n\\n### AI: A Test of Innovation and Leadership\\n\\nThe forecast also indicates that the adoption of agents and Agentic AI will accelerate innovation in how companies use technology and code to transform their business. These investments and the evolution of related products will increasingly determine the success or failure of the business and tech leaders who put them in place, and the businesses that use them. For this reason, informed leadership will be critical to success during these next several years.\\n\\n“This research reveals several important issues for businesses to consider about the interconnection between labor and AI investment,” said Crawford Del Prete, president at IDC. “As an example, business leaders will need to pay particular attention to employee roles in an enterprise, and how roles change as agents become more commonplace in business. Agents will change the nature of work, making some roles highly productive, and others obsolete. Workers and enterprises will need to be more agile than ever before to keep pace.”\\n\\n### As AI Surges, Parts of the Tech Stack Plateau\\n\\nCoinciding with this growth in AI spending is a massive increase in the amount of underlying compute capacity required to support this agent growth. In the short term, this will require significant and complex build-out from infrastructure providers, which will be led by cloud providers.\\n\\nLong term, the focus on AI will likely divert funding in other areas of the tech stack. Whether from an enterprise or a service provider, spending on IT, such as servers and storage, which are not related to AI, will be driven by efficiency and consolidation, limiting growth.\\n\\n###### Related Topics\\n\\n- [AI & ML](/content/ai-ml/),\\n- [Digital Platforms and Services](/content/digital-platforms-services/),\\n- [Enterprise](/content/enterprise/),\\n- [Global](/content/global/),\\n- [IDC](/content/idc/),\\n- [Tracker](/content/tracker/)\\n\\n###### More Like This\\n\\n### Access Evolution\\n\\n#### What’s up with… T-Mobile US, mobile network investments, Ericsson\\n\\n### Digital Platforms and Services\\n\\n#### IBM and AMD join forces to build the future of computing\\n\\n### 5G Evolution\\n\\n#### What’s up with… Echostar/Boost Mobile, AT&T, Open RAN\\n\\n### Security\\n\\n#### Netskope pulls its IPO trigger\\n\\n### Digital Platforms and Services\\n\\n#### SONiC strengthens global collaboration with seven new members\\n\\n##### Newsletters\\n\\nGet the latest news analysis and expert insights delivered to your inbox.\\n\\n Please enter your work email address below\\n\\n That email address is already registered with us.

It measures five enterprise metrics — accuracy, cost, speed, trust and safety, and sustainability — to determine agents’ readiness for real-world deployments.\\n\\n##### [ Related:Agentic AI – Ongoing news and insights]\\n\\nSalesforce noted it added sustainability as a new metric that highlights the relative environmental impact of AI systems, and is intended to help businesses align model size with the specific level of intelligence required by an agent to complete an enterprise-specific task, minimizing the computational resources the agent uses.\\n\\nIn addition, Salesforce AI Research has published two complementary benchmarks, MCP-Eval and MCP-Universe, which are designed to measure agents and track LLMs as they interact with MCP servers in real-world use cases.\\n\\nMCP-Eval uses synthetic tasks for scalable, automatic evaluation across a wide range of MCP servers, whereas MCP-Universe leverages challenging, real-world tasks with execution-based evaluators to stress-test agents in complex scenarios.\\n\\n## Autonomously consolidating duplicated account data\\n\\nFinally, Account Matching is a new Data Cloud capability intended to help ensure AI agents have access to high-quality, unified data. Salesforce AI Research partnered with Salesforce product teams to fine-tune LLMs and SLMs to power Account Matching, which can identify duplicated records, incomplete fields, and inconsistent naming conventions, and reconcile them across data systems into a single, authoritative record.\\n\\nSalesforce pointed to one customer that used a proprietary tool leveraging Account Matching that was able to unify more than a million accounts with a 95% match success rate in just the first month, and it reduced average handling time by 30 minutes.\\n\\n \\n## Related content\\n\\n \\n\\n[BrandPostSponsored by SAS### Fast-track AI’s value with a ready-made-model approachBy Beth StackpoleAug 27, 20253 minsArtificial Intelligence](https://www.cio.com/article/4047075/fast-track-ais-value-with-a-ready-made-model-approach.html)\\n\\n[BrandPostSponsored by OpenText### The dual threat of AI and quantum computing: IT leaders brace for the next data security eraBy Joan GoodchildAug 27, 20256 minsArtificial IntelligenceDigital Transformation](https://www.cio.com/article/4046977/the-dual-threat-of-ai-and-quantum-computing-it-leaders-brace-for-the-next-data-security-era.html)\\n\\n[Opinion### Beyond siloed AI: How vertical and horizontal intelligence create the truly smart enterpriseBy Chinmay ShepalAug 27, 20258 minsArtificial IntelligenceDigital TransformationIT Strategy](https://www.cio.com/article/4046287/beyond-siloed-ai-how-vertical-and-horizontal-intelligence-create-the-truly-smart-enterprise.html)\\n\\n## Other Sections\\n\\n- [PODCASTS](https://www.cio.com/podcasts/)\\n- [VIDEOS](https://www.cio.com/videos/)\\n- [RESOURCES](https://us.resources.cio.com)\\n- [EVENTS](https://www.cio.com/events/)\\n- [Spotlight: AI-ready data centers](https://www.cio.com/it-operations/)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\\t\\t\\t\\n### From our editors straight to your inbox\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGet started by entering your email address below.\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n \\n\\nPlease enter a valid email address\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tby \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Thor Olavsrud](https://www.cio.com/profile/thor-olavsrud/)\\n\\nSenior Writer\\n\\n1.

The findings highlight that advancements in human-agent interactions will set new standards for how teams work and how systems are orchestrated within businesses.\\n\\n**Rapid evolution**\\n\\nGartner\\'s Senior Director Analyst, Anushree Verma, said, \"AI agents are evolving rapidly, progressing from basic assistants embedded in enterprise applications today to task-specific agents by 2026 and ultimately multiagent ecosystems by 2029. This shift transforms enterprise applications from tools supporting individual productivity into platforms enabling seamless autonomous collaboration and dynamic workflow orchestration.\"\\n\\nOrganisations are currently at an inflection point in the development and deployment of agentic AI. Gartner advises that Chief Information Officers have a key three- to six-month window to establish a clear strategy or risk lagging behind peers who embrace new agentic AI capabilities earlier. The report suggests a focused approach across a framework of five stages in the evolution of agentic AI in enterprise settings.\\n\\n**Stages of agentic AI**\\n\\nThe first stage is characterised by AI assistants embedded into nearly every enterprise application by the end of 2025. These assistants help transform previously inefficient applications into systems that automate tasks on behalf of users. However, these assistants still require human input and do not operate independently. Gartner warns that the distinction between AI assistants and agents is often blurred, due in part to what it terms \\'agent washing\\'.\\n\\nVerma stated, \"CIOs and technology leaders must focus on creating seamless employee experiences by integrating AI assistants with robust APIs, enabling a shift from traditional application-centric interfaces.\"\\n\\nBy 2026, Gartner forecasts that AI assistants will have developed into agents with specialised task capabilities. At this stage, 40% of enterprise applications are forecast to be integrated with these task-specialised agents.\\n\\n\"As AI agents begin acting independently and handle tasks ranging from routine development to complex incident response without human involvement, leaders must ensure strong security and governance,\" said Verma.\\n\\n**Collaborative agents**\\n\\nThe third stage, anticipated by 2027, involves collaborative AI agents operating within the same application. Gartner predicts that one-third of agentic AI implementations at this time will consist of agents with differing skill sets managing complex tasks collectively in application and data environments. The industry currently focuses on single-purpose automation, but Gartner expects greater business impact from collaborative agents that can learn from data in real time and adapt as situations evolve.\\n\\nAt this phase, Gartner emphasises that technology leaders should consider standardisation, interoperability, and the adoption of protocols that promote smooth agent-to-agent communication.\\n\\n**Ecosystems and new business models**\\n\\nThe fourth stage, by 2028, forecasts networks of specialised AI agents able to dynamically collaborate across different applications, allowing users to accomplish objectives without direct interaction with each piece of software. Gartner suggests that this could result in changes to business models, increased requirements for transparency, new pricing structures, and further emphasis on ethical standards and governance.\\n\\nGartner estimates that by 2028, one-third of user experiences will transition from using native applications to interacting with agentic front ends. This is predicted to require entirely new business models to address potential disintermediation caused by these changes.\\n\\n**A new normal**\\n\\nThe fifth and final stage, forecast for 2029, predicts that at least half of knowledge workers will have acquired new skills needed to work with, manage, and even create AI agents capable of handling complex workflows on demand.\\n\\nVerma said, \"As agentic AI matures, standardised protocols and frameworks will enable seamless interoperability, allowing agents to sense their environments, orchestrate projects and support a wide range of business scenarios. Early adopters will set the standard for the new normal while others risk falling behind as humans begin relying on AI agents as much as their smartphones.\"\\n\\nGartner\\'s analysis suggests that as agentic AI becomes more ingrained in enterprise software and operations, organisations will face new challenges and opportunities, especially regarding governance, security, and interoperability. Companies that promptly address these areas are likely to be better positioned in an environment where reliance on autonomous AI agents continues to grow.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFollow us on:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShare on:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRelated stories\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n[Exclusive: The \\'godfather of process mining\\' on its past and future](/story/exclusive-the-godfather-of-process-mining-on-its-past-and-future)\\n[Specops extends uReset to boost cloud Entra ID password security](/story/specops-extends-ureset-to-boost-cloud-entra-id-password-security)\\n[Retail leads AI satisfaction as healthcare outspends all sectors](/story/retail-leads-ai-satisfaction-as-healthcare-outspends-all-sectors)\\n[Cybersecurity leaders urge more women to lead sector evolution](/story/cybersecurity-leaders-urge-more-women-to-lead-sector-evolution)\\n[Tenable named leader for unified AI-powered exposure management](/story/tenable-named-leader-for-unified-ai-powered-exposure-management)\\n\\n## Top stories\\n\\n[How storage is powering Australia’s AI ambitions](/story/how-storage-is-powering-australia-s-ai-ambitions)\\n[Ransomware attacks stable in July but threat remains high, warns report](/story/ransomware-attacks-stable-in-july-but-threat-remains-high-warns-report)\\n[Salesforce unveils AI tools for Australian government expansion](/story/salesforce-unveils-ai-tools-for-australian-government-expansion)\\n[Data quality gaps threaten AI progress & compliance in business](/story/data-quality-gaps-threaten-ai-progress-compliance-in-business)\\n[Women CFOs linked to 10% shareholder return rise, report finds](/story/women-cfos-linked-to-10-shareholder-return-rise-report-finds)\\n\\n## Our Australian network\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFintech\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTechnology news for CFOs & financial decision-makers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n[Visit](https://cfotech.com.au)\\n[Media Kit](https://cfotech.com.au/media-kit)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIndustry\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIndustry insider news for technology resellers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n[Visit](https://channellife.com.au)\\n[Media Kit](https://channellife.com.au/media-kit)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCommerce\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTechnology news for digital commerce decision-makers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n[Visit](https://ecommercenews.com.au)\\n[Media Kit](https://ecommercenews.com.au/media-kit)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tConsumer tech\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tConsumer technology news from the future\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n[Visit](https://futurefive.com.au)\\n[Media Kit](https://futurefive.com.au/media-kit)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEnterprise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTechnology news for CIOs & IT decision-makers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n[Visit](https://itbrief.com.au)\\n[Media Kit](https://itbrief.com.au/media-kit)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCybersecurity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTechnology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n[Visit](https://securitybrief.com.au)\\n[Media Kit](https://securitybrief.com.au/media-kit)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTelecommunications\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTelecommunications news for ICT decision-makers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n[Visit](https://telconews.com.au)\\n[Media Kit](https://telconews.com.au/media-kit)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTechDay operates in other regions, see our [Asian](https://techday.asia), [Canadian](https://techdayca.com), [Indian](https://techday.in), [Kiwi](https://techday.co.nz), [UK](https://techday.co.uk) & [American](https://techday.com) sites.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n## About us\\n\\n[Contact us](/contact-us)\\n[Editorial features](/editorial-feature-list)\\n[FAQ](/tag/frequently-asked-questions)\\n[Our AI Policy](/our-ai-policy)\\n[Media kit](/media-kit)\\n[Our team](/our-team)\\n[Our terms](/our-terms)\\n[Subscribe](/subscribe)\\n\\n\\t© 2025 TechDay, All rights reserved.

By integrating Domo\\'s Agent Catalyst platform with AWS\\'s scalable cloud infrastructure and advanced AI tools, the partnership is accelerating the deployment of autonomous agents capable of managing complex workflows with unprecedented efficiency. This strategic alignment not only addresses critical gaps in enterprise AI competency but also creates a compelling value proposition for shareholders, as both companies capitalize on the growing demand for intelligent automation.  \\n### The Agentic AI Revolution: Bridging the Enterprise AI Gap\\n\\nAccording to ISG Research, over half of enterprises will recognize their AI skills as insufficient by 2027. Domo and AWS\\'s collaboration directly tackles this challenge by democratizing access to agentic AI. Domo\\'s Agent Catalyst platform, enhanced by AWS\\'s memory and learning capabilities, enables the creation of domain-specific AI agents that adapt to user behavior and evolve over time. These agents autonomously act on real-time data, delivering personalized insights and automating workflows in industries ranging from legal services (via partners like Filevine) to finance and healthcare.  \\n\\nThe partnership\\'s focus on security, governance, and human oversight ensures that enterprises can adopt AI without compromising compliance or operational integrity. For example, AWS\\'s SageMaker integration allows Domo to deploy machine learning models at scale, while AWS Data Exchange listings in the Domo Appstore streamline data access for customers. This synergy reduces the technical barriers to AI adoption, enabling organizations to transition from pilot projects to production-ready solutions rapidly.  \\n### Financial Implications: Shareholder Value in a $640B AI Market\\n\\nDomo\\'s fiscal 2025 results underscore the financial potential of this collaboration. Despite ongoing losses, the company reported $317 million in annual revenue, a 14% year-over-year increase in Subscription Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), and a 38% rise in RPO expected beyond 12 months. These metrics reflect growing demand for Domo\\'s AI-driven analytics, particularly as enterprises seek to operationalize AI insights.  \\n\\nAWS, meanwhile, continues to dominate the AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) market. In Q1 2025, AWS reported $29.3 billion in net sales—a 17% year-over-year increase—with an operating margin of 39.5%. The segment\\'s profitability is bolstered by partnerships like the one with Domo, which leverages AWS\\'s infrastructure to deliver scalable AI solutions. A Forrester study highlights that Domo\\'s use of AWS-powered automation saved hundreds of hours in manual processes for tasks like predicting game viewership, directly enhancing operational efficiency and ROI for clients.  \\n### Strategic Positioning in the AIaaS Ecosystem\\n\\nThe Domo-AWS collaboration aligns with broader market trends. As enterprises prioritize AI-driven decision-making, the AIaaS market is projected to grow at a rapid CAGR, with AWS, Google, and [Microsoft](//www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/)[MSFT--](//www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/) leading the charge. Domo\\'s integration into AWS\\'s Partner Network (APN) reinforces its role as a trusted provider of AI-powered analytics, while AWS benefits from Domo\\'s expertise in enterprise data storytelling and automation.  \\n\\nThis partnership also addresses a critical pain point: the “model graveyard” phenomenon, where AI models fail to transition from development to real-world use. By embedding AI insights directly into dashboards and workflows, Domo ensures that models remain actionable and relevant, reducing the risk of underutilization. This approach not only improves business outcomes but also strengthens customer retention, a key driver of long-term shareholder value.  \\n### Investment Considerations: Balancing Risk and Reward\\n\\nFor investors, the Domo-AWS collaboration presents both opportunities and risks. On the upside, the partnership positions Domo to capture a growing share of the agentic AI market, which [Gartner](//www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-IT/)[IT--](//www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-IT/) has identified as a top 2025 technology trend. AWS\\'s robust infrastructure and Domo\\'s domain-specific AI agents create a defensible moat in an increasingly competitive landscape.  \\n\\nHowever, challenges remain. Domo\\'s non-GAAP net loss of $20 million in fiscal 2025 highlights the need for continued cost management. Additionally, the AIaaS market is highly competitive, with Microsoft and Google investing heavily in similar capabilities. Investors should monitor Domo\\'s ability to convert RPO into recurring revenue and AWS\\'s capacity to maintain its 39.5% operating margin amid rising R&D costs.  \\n### Conclusion: A Win-Win for Enterprise and Shareholders\\n\\nThe Domo-AWS collaboration exemplifies how strategic partnerships can drive enterprise AI adoption while creating shareholder value. By combining Domo\\'s agentic AI expertise with AWS\\'s cloud infrastructure, the partnership addresses critical gaps in AI competency, scalability, and governance. As enterprises increasingly prioritize automation and real-time decision-making, this alliance is well-positioned to capture market share in a $640 billion AI ecosystem.  \\n\\nFor investors, the key takeaway is clear: the integration of agentic AI into core business processes is no longer a futuristic concept but a present-day imperative.

But let’s be real—this is just a shiny dashboard for the ‘model graveyard’ they can’t dig out of. Domo’s still bleeding cash, and AWS is just another cloud bro riding the AIaaS wave. Enterprises are buying vibes, not solutions. This isn’t the future—it’s just the same old tech bro hustle with more buzzwords. Where’s the ROI? Still in the ‘predictive’ column, probably.
