OpenAI leadership talked about agentic AI being a \"[big theme in 2025](https://mashable.com/article/openai-sam-altman-ama-reddit)\" and has already introduced a research preview of Operator, an [agent](https://mashable.com/article/openai-announces-operator-ai-agent-to-browse-the-web-for-you) that can perform tasks on your behalf, and [Deep Research](https://mashable.com/article/openai-launches-deep-research-ai-agent-chatgpt), which \"conducts multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks.\" Microsoft just [unveiled Microsoft Discover](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/transforming-rd-with-agentic-ai-introducing-microsoft-discovery/), an enterprise agentic AI tool for scientists. And your next smartphone could have agentic features that can send custom messages, create calendar events, or pull together information from across different apps. \\n\\nIf you\\'ve been nodding and smiling every time one of your tech friends mentions agentic AI, don\\'t be embarrassed. This is a [new entry in the AI glossary](https://mashable.com/article/ai-definitions-artificial-intelligence-glossary-terms), but one that can no longer be ignored.\\n\\n**You May Also Like**\\n\\n******Google\\'s Pixel 10 Pro Fold Is Here\\n\\n## So what exactly is agentic AI?\\n\\n\"Agentic AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems designed to operate autonomously, perceive their environment, set goals, plan actions to achieve those goals, and execute those plans without continuous human intervention. These systems can learn and adapt over time based on feedback and new information.\" \\n\\nThat\\'s according to —\\xa0what else? — Google\\'s [AI chatbot Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app).\\n\\nUnlike generative AI, which is essentially a tool for creating some kind of output — code, text, audio, images, videos — agentic AI can autonomously perform tasks on a user\\'s behalf. This is a step up from the standard AI chatbot experience. Instead of generating a response based on its training material, agentic AI can take additional steps, such as conducting internet searches and analyzing the results, consulting additional sources, or completing a task in another app or software.\\n\\nYou may have heard this term used interchangeably with AI agents, but agentic AI is a broader term that encompasses technology that may not be *fully* autonomous but has some agent-like capabilities.\\xa0\\n\\nSo, OpenAI considers Operator an AI agent because it has contextual awareness and can perform tasks for you like sending text messages. And its Deep Research tool is agentic AI because it can autonomously crawl the web and compile a report for the user, though its capabilities pretty much stop there for now. \\n\\nAgentic AI is powered by more advanced reasoning models like ChatGPT o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, which can break down complex tasks and make inferences. This brings large-language models like ChatGPT one step closer to mimicking how the human brain works. Unless you constantly retrain a generative AI model with new information, it can\\'t learn new things, said [Karen Panetta, IEEE Fellow and professor of engineering](https://engineering.tufts.edu/me/people/faculty/karen-panetta) at Tufts University. \"This other kind of AI can learn from seeing other examples, and it can be more autonomous in breaking down tasks and helping you with more goal-driven types of activities, versus more exploratory or giving back information.\"\\n\\nWhen combined with computer vision, which is what allows a model to \"see\" a user\\'s computer screen, we get the agentic AI everyone is so excited about. \\n\\n            Mashable Light Speed\\n        \\n\\nWant more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?\\nSign up for Mashable\\'s weekly Light Speed newsletter.\\n\\nLoading...\\nSign Me Up\\n\\n                By clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.ziffdavis.com/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.ziffdavis.com/ztg-privacy-policy).\\n            \\n\\nThanks for signing up!\\n\\n## Why is everyone talking about agentic AI?\\n\\nGoogle\\'s new AI shopping experience could utilize agentic AI to make purchases on your behalf.\\nCredit: Google\\n\\nAgentic AI is not entirely new. Self-driving cars and robot vacuums could both be considered early examples of agentic AI. They\\'re technologies with autonomous properties that rely on advanced sensors and cameras to make sense of their environment and react accordingly.\\n\\nBut agentic AI is having its moment now for a few reasons. Crucially, the latest models have gotten better and more user-friendly (although [sometimes*too *friendly](https://mashable.com/article/openai-rolls-back-sycophant-chatgpt-update)). And as people begin to rely on AI chatbots like ChatGPT, there\\'s a growing interest in using these tools to automate  daily tasks like responding to emails. With agentic AI, you don\\'t need to be a computer programmer to use ChatGPT for automation. You can simply tell the chatbot what to do in plain English and have it carry out your instructions. At least, that\\'s the idea.\\n\\nCompanies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are banking on agentic AI because it has the potential to move the technology beyond the novelty chatbot experience. With agentic AI, tools like ChatGPT could become truly indispensable for businesses and individuals alike. Agentic AI tools could order groceries online, browse and buy the best-reviewed espresso machine for you, or even research and book vacations. In fact, Google is already taking steps in this direction with [its new AI shopping experience](https://mashable.com/article/openai-chatgpt-shopping-update-more-like-google-search).\\n\\nIn the business world, companies are looking to agentic AI to [resolve customer service inquiries](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-are-companies-using-ai-agents-heres-a-look-at-five-early-users-of-the-bots-26f87845) and [adjust stock trading strategies](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/12/agentic-ai-financial-services-autonomy-efficiency-and-inclusion/) in real-time. \\n## What could possibly go wrong?\\n\\n[This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1912192384588271771)\\n\\nAre there risks involved with unleashing autonomous bots in the wild? Why, yes. \\n\\nWith an agent operating on your behalf, there\\'s always a risk of it sending a sensitive email to the wrong person or accidentally making a huge purchase. And then there\\'s the question of liability. \"Am I going to be sued because I went and had my agent do something?\" Panetta wondered. \"Say I\\'m working as an officer of something, and I use an AI agent to make a decision, to help us do our planning, and then you lose that organization money.\"\\xa0\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\n- [Can ChatGPT pass the Turing Test yet?](/article/chatgpt-turing-test)\\n- [As AI manufacturing grows, so does the tech\\'s environmental damage](/article/ai-manufacturing-grows-so-does-environmental-harm)\\n- [I\\'m a college writing professor. Here\\'s what AI still can\\'t do](/article/how-a-college-writing-professor-teaches-students-about-ai)\\n\\nThe major AI players have put safeguards in place to prevent AI agents from going rogue, such as requiring human supervision or approval for sensitive tasks. OpenAI [says](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/) Operator won\\'t take screenshots when it\\'s in human override mode, and it doesn\\'t currently allow its agent to make banking transactions. \\n\\nBut what about when the technology becomes more commonplace? As we become more comfortable with agentic AI, will we become more passive and lax about oversight? Earlier in this article, we used Google Gemini to help define agentic AI. If we become dependent on AI tools for even simple learning, [will human beings get dumber](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dimitarmixmihov/2025/02/11/ai-is-making-you-dumber-microsoft-researchers-say/)?\\n\\nThen there\\'s the extensive data access we have to give agents. Sure, it would be convenient for ChatGPT to automatically filter, sort, or even delete emails. But do you want to give an AI company full access to every email you\\'ve ever sent or received?\\n\\nAnd what about bad actors that don\\'t have such safeguards in place? Panetta warns of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks utilizing agentic AI.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Because the access to powerful computing now is so cheap, that means that the bad actors have access to it,\" she said. \"They can be running simulations and being able to come up with sophisticated schemes to break into your systems or connive you into taking out this equity loan.\"\\xa0\\n\\nAI has always been a double-edged sword, with equally potent harms and benefits. And with agentic AI getting ready for primetime deployment, the stakes are getting higher.\\n\\n*Disclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.*\\n\\nTopics\\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence)\\n[OpenAI](https://mashable.com/category/openai)\\n\\nCecily Mauran\\nTech Reporter\\n\\nCecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.

Kus detailed the critical shift from initial, often brittle, LLM-based solutions to a robust, multi-step agentic framework designed to tackle the formidable challenge of unstructured enterprise data.\\n\\nKus shared that Box’s initial foray into AI in 2023 involved deploying LLMs for tasks like metadata extraction, summarization, and Q&A. While promising for simple use cases, these pure LLM approaches quickly hit a wall when confronted with the vast, often messy, and highly variable unstructured data prevalent across enterprise documents. The core problem was reliability. LLMs, despite their intelligence, proved prone to “hallucinations, inconsistency, and fragility,” making them unsuitable for mission-critical data extraction where accuracy is paramount. Debugging these black-box systems was notoriously difficult, leading to what Kus described as “despair” within the engineering teams.\\n\\nThis frustration catalyzed a fundamental architectural pivot. Box recognized that an LLM is a powerful “brain,” but it requires a sophisticated operational framework to be truly effective. The solution was an agentic architecture, where the LLM acts as the central reasoning engine, but is equipped with a suite of tools—ranging from traditional regex patterns to external APIs—and operates within a structured “Plan, Act, Observe, Reflect” loop. This framework allows the agent to intelligently assess a task, select the appropriate tools, execute steps, validate outcomes, and self-correct, much like a human expert.\\n \\n\\nFor instance, extracting an invoice number no longer relies solely on an LLM guessing the correct string. Instead, the agent first identifies the document type, then employs a precise regex tool for structured fields, only resorting to the LLM for more ambiguous or unstructured text. This hybrid approach significantly boosts accuracy and reduces the common pitfalls of pure generative models. It provides a level of observability that was previously impossible, allowing engineers to trace the agent’s decision-making process and pinpoint errors.\\n\\nA crucial takeaway from Box’s experience, articulated emphatically by Kus, is the imperative to adopt an agentic architecture from the outset for any serious AI application. “If you’re building any kind of serious AI application, you should be building an agentic architecture from day one,” he advised. Attempting to retrofit such a system onto a pure LLM foundation is far more complex and costly than designing it in from the ground up. This proactive approach ensures scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness by judiciously deploying LLM compute only when necessary, rather than for every single step. Box’s journey underscores that for enterprise AI, the future is not just about smarter models, but smarter systems that orchestrate those models with precision and purpose.\\n\\n[Agentic AI](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/agentic-ai/)[AI](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/ai/)[Ben Kus](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/ben-kus/)[Box](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/box/)[Enterprise Software](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/enterprise-software/)[LLM](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/llm/)[Product Innovation](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/product-innovation/)[Unstructured Data](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/unstructured-data/) \\n\\n### Trending Startups\\n\\nAI Agents and Tools\\n\\n[#### Kubiya](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/kubiya/)\\n\\n[#### Rocket.new](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/rocket-new/)\\n\\n[#### PROMAI](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/promai/)\\n\\n[#### AI21 Labs](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/ai21/)\\n\\n[#### Lema Labs](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/lema-labs/)\\n\\n[#### Dream](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/dream/)\\n\\n[#### Fabrix Security](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/fabrix-security/)\\n\\nLoading next article\\n\\n### 🔥 Trending Startups\\n\\nUpdated Daily\\n\\n© 2025 StartupHub.ai.

We were already expecting a summer launch, but big models are often subject to delays. So, this is great potential news for fans of the popular AI chatbot, though official details remain scarce.\\n\\nUnofficial details, rumors, and leaks, on the other hand, are plentiful.\\n\\nSo, what can we expect from ChatGPT 5?\\n\\n**You May Also Like**\\n\\n************0:00/3:18**Biggest Winners & Losers from China\\'s World Humanoid Robot GamesBiggest Winners & Losers from China\\'s World Humanoid Robot Games\\n\\n## ChatGPT 5, explained\\n\\nIf you\\'re a casual ChatGPT user, then chances are most of your prompts are handled by GPT-4o. That\\'s the default version of the chatbot that OpenAI describes as \"great for most tasks.\" However, OpenAI is always cooking up new releases. In fact, the AI company has been releasing new AI tools at a breakneck pace in 2025. (Whether it can sustain that pace after [Meta went on an AI talent poaching spree](https://mashable.com/article/zuckerberg-reportedly-assembling-superintelligence-group-meta-ai), we\\'ll have to wait and see.)\\n\\nSo far this year, OpenAI released a hugely [popular image generation tool](https://mashable.com/article/openai-announces-chatgpt-sora-native-image-generation) (Remember the Studio Ghibli image trend, right? What about the [Studio Ghibli trend backlash](https://mashable.com/article/studio-ghibli-ai-memes-openai-chatgpt)?). Then, in April, the company dropped two new reasoning models, [o3 and o4-mini](https://mashable.com/article/openai-announced-o3-o4-mini-reasoning-models-chatgpt). The company also delivered its [Operator AI agent](https://mashable.com/article/openai-announces-operator-ai-agent-to-browse-the-web-for-you), a new [education initiative with Microsoft and teachers](https://mashable.com/article/free-ai-academy-national-teachers-union-microsoft-open-ai), and another, smarter reasoning model, [o3-pro](https://mashable.com/article/openai-launches-smarter-reasoning-model-o3pro). And in addition to ChatGPT-5, the company announced it will be making an [AI wearable with iPhone designer Jony Ive](https://mashable.com/article/openai-jony-ive-develop-ai-first-devices), and is also rumored to be [working on an AI browser](https://mashable.com/article/openai-chatgpt-browser), among other projects.\\n\\nHowever, ChatGPT-5 will be a particularly notable release, as it should bring noticeable improvements to the everyday ChatGPT experience.\\n## What do we know about GPT-5?\\n\\nWe don\\'t know much officially yet, except that GPT-5 is actively being tested. On July 23, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman [sat down with podcaster Theo Von](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYn8VKW6vXA), and he brought up GPT-5 repeatedly, saying, \"5.0 I think is going to be great.\"\\n\\nLater, he described what it\\'s like testing the new model:\\n\\n            Mashable Light Speed\\n        \\n\\nWant more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?\\nSign up for Mashable\\'s weekly Light Speed newsletter.\\n\\nLoading...\\nSign Me Up\\n\\n                By clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our [Terms of Use](https://www.ziffdavis.com/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.ziffdavis.com/ztg-privacy-policy).\\n            \\n\\nThanks for signing up!\\n\\nThis morning I was testing our new model, and I got a question. I got emailed a question that I didn\\'t quite understand. And I put it in the model, this GPT5, and it answered it perfectly. And I really kind of sat back in my chair, and I was just like, *oh man, here it is moment*. And I got over it quickly. I got busy onto the next thing, but it was like...I felt, like, useless relative to the AI in this thing that I felt like I should have been able to do. And I couldn’t, and it was really hard, but the AI just did it like that. Yeah, it was it was a weird feeling.\\n\\nOf course, I feel like I\\'ve heard AI leaders tell a version of this anecdote every time they\\'re promoting an imminent release. \\n\\nWe expect GPT-5 to offer more [agentic capabilities](https://helios-preview.mashable.com/article/agentic-ai-explainer).\\n## ChatGPT-5 could combine multiple models and tools\\n\\nCurrently, ChatGPT users can toggle between different models, from GPT-4 to advanced reasoning models. OpenAI also has tools like Sora, for video generation, and Operator, a web-based AI agent.\\n\\nHowever, [Tech Radar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/rumors-of-gpt-5-are-multiplying-as-the-expected-release-date-approaches) points to rumors from early testers that GPT-5 will combine these various tools into a single interface, which would let you generate images, conduct deep research, or write code.\\n## Better coding abilities\\n\\nEarlier this month, Altman shared this story on X, which many users assume refers to GPT-5.\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\n- [Classroom platform Canvas getting more AI features, courtesy of OpenAI](/article/open-ai-education-canvas-partnership)\\n- [How many people use ChatGPT? Hint: OpenAI sees more than 1 billion prompts per day.](/article/openai-how-many-people-use-chatgpt)\\n- [Trump sides with Big Tech in AI copyright battle — \"China’s not doing it\"](/article/trump-sides-with-big-tech-ai-copyright-debate)\\n\\nBig model releases usually deliver incremental improvements on core abilities like image generation and coding, and we expect that will be the case with the new model from OpenAI.\\n## GPT is \"coming soon,\" OpenAI leaders promise\\n\\nWe know that Altman isn\\'t the only one testing GPT-5. And while discussing OpenAI\\'s recent gold medal at a math Olympiad, OpenAI research scientist Alexander Wei promised, \"we are releasing GPT-5 soon.\"\\n\\n[Tech Radar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/rumors-of-gpt-5-are-multiplying-as-the-expected-release-date-approaches) also cites independent researchers who spotted a reference to the model in \"OpenAI’s internal BioSec Benchmark repository, suggesting the model is already being trialed in sensitive domains like biosecurity.\"\\n## Larger context windows\\n\\nWith each new model, OpenAI expands ChatGPT\\'s context window. That term refers to how much data a model can \"remember\" when responding to a prompt. ChatGPT developers and users are [actively calling for larger context windows](https://community.openai.com/t/we-need-bigger-context-windows-in-chatgpt/1290633) (the exact size varies by model), and we\\'d be shocked if this wasn\\'t a part of GPT-5.\\n\\nTo be candid, OpenAI has done a pretty good job of keeping GPT-5 leaks to a minimum. Besides a few cryptic references that the model is coming soon, OpenAI has kept pretty strict message discipline around the upcoming model.\\n\\nTopics\\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence)\\n[OpenAI](https://mashable.com/category/openai)\\n\\nTimothy Beck Werth\\nTech Editor\\n\\nTimothy Beck Werth is the Tech Editor at Mashable, where he leads coverage and assignments for the Tech and Shopping verticals.

Teachers can then use insights from the LLM to evaluate student submissions. \"This feature provides a meaningful way to teach students how to use these tools responsibly and effectively, all within a high-quality pedagogical framework that encourages critical thinking and supports higher-order skills,\" said Shiren Vijiasingam, chief product officer at Instructure.\\n\\nAnthropic, makers of chatbot Claude, announced an [integration with Canvas\\' Learning Tools Interoperability](https://mashable.com/article/anthropic-ai-law-school-classroom-integration) in June, which lets students use Claude directly in the Canvas platform while doing coursework — users will still be able to enable Claude (and other integrated tools) alongside the OpenAI partnership. Across the board, AI\\'s biggest players have chosen to invest heavily in the technology\\'s educational applications, including teacher tools, student skill building, and a [free, nationwide training program](https://mashable.com/article/free-ai-academy-national-teachers-union-microsoft-open-ai) for educators in partnership with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). \\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\n- [How many people use ChatGPT?

The PM Role Has Changed.\\n\\nPMs are shifting from specification writers to evaluation architects. You now define what AI products should achieve and measure capabilities, not just write feature requirements.\\n\\n2. Prototypes Beat Documentation.\\n\\nStop writing lengthy PRDs. Build functional AI demonstrations that show exactly how products work, accelerating feedback cycles and eliminating interpretation gaps between teams.\\n\\n3. Every PM Needs Agents.\\n\\nIf you're not building agent-first products, you're building something obsolete. Design for task completion and asynchronous workflows, not just question-answer interactions.\\n\\n4. Managing Agents Is Coming.\\n\\nPMs will soon manage both humans and AI agents. Learn prompt engineering, set delegation boundaries, and decide when humans need to stay in the loop.\\n\\n5. Empathy Becomes Your Advantage.\\n\\nAs technical tasks automate, human skills matter more. Understanding diverse users, team dynamics, and communication styles becomes your competitive edge over AI.\\n\\n6. Research Drives Product Strategy.\\n\\nOpenAI starts with AI breakthroughs, then finds applications. This research-first approach requires unprecedented collaboration between product and research teams from day one.\\n\\n7. Planning Embraces Failure.\\n\\nAssume only 60-70% plan completion. Lightweight documents and async reviews work better than rigid roadmaps when building in uncertain AI environments.\\n\\n8. Infrastructure Enables Everything.\\n\\nIdentity systems, payment rails, and safety measures determine whether AI products reach users or crash. Build platform reliability before you need it.\\n\\n9. AI Fluency Is Baseline.\\n\\nTechnical familiarity with AI products and APIs is now required for all PMs. Combine this baseline with domain expertise to tackle unprecedented problems.\\n\\n10.

A project getting “done” in a week doesn’t mean it’s correct, secure, scalable or maintainable. That’s where human expertise matters.\\n\\nSaying it’s a no brainer to hire AI over people ignores the fact that AI depends entirely on human knowledge, design and oversight. Without skilled developers, you’ll just deliver low-quality code faster.\\n\\nUpskilling is important, yes, but replacing humans with AI is short-sighted. The companies that thrive will be the ones that combine human creativity with AI efficiency, not the ones that think copy-pasting machine output is a substitute for real engineering.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Ftalifhani-banks-199279ab_so-ai-agents-are-really-replacing-jobs-activity-7365410156689448961-Ybi0&trk=public_post_comment_like)\\n\\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Ftalifhani-banks-199279ab_so-ai-agents-are-really-replacing-jobs-activity-7365410156689448961-Ybi0&trk=public_post_comment_reply)\\n[3\\xa0Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Ftalifhani-banks-199279ab_so-ai-agents-are-really-replacing-jobs-activity-7365410156689448961-Ybi0&trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\\n\\n                4\\xa0Reactions\\n              \\n\\n[Patrick Odhiambo](https://ke.linkedin.com/in/patdevops?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\\n\\nMulticloud Engineer || 2x AWS Certified || 3x Azure Certified || Software Engineer- Backend ||Terraform Associate || KCNA || HashiCorp Ambassador || Building Secure, Scalable Infrastructure-as-Code Solutions\\n\\n          \\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\n      5h\\n  \\n        \\n\\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Ftalifhani-banks-199279ab_so-ai-agents-are-really-replacing-jobs-activity-7365410156689448961-Ybi0&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\\n\\n \\n\\nFair view, however, I would ask, Upskill to what ?

Our unemployment rate remains one of the highest in the world, roughly 36% among Black/African people, 22% among Coloured people, 12% among Indian/Asian people, and 8% among White people, and that context can’t be ignored.\\nI absolutely love innovation and its potential, but I think the real question for us is: Are we leveraging AI in a way that suits South Africa’s unique circumstances? Can we use it to uplift the youth, create opportunities, and reduce unemployment rather than exacerbate it?\\nIf businesses simply replace workers to maximize profit, we risk worsening unemployment, which already fuels crime, poverty, and hopelessness among our youth. With the social grants, realistically to “upskill” is wishful thinking at the pace this landscape demands — especially when even highly skilled workers remain unemployed.\\nAI is powerful, and “upskilling” is essential, but we need a broader conversation: How do we balance innovation with social impact, and build solutions that drive both business growth and inclusive economic progress?\\n\\n \\n\\n

\\n\\n🛠️🧭 How to Build AI Agents from Scratch – Even If You’ve Never Done It Before.\\n𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝟭𝟬 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗺𝗮𝗽 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗘𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: Define the Agent’s Role and Goal\\n✸ What will your agent do?\\n✸ Who is it helping?\\n✸ What kind of output will it generate?\\n→ Example: A medical assistant agent that reads X-rays, summarizes findings, and speaks results.\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: Design Structured Input & Output\\n✸ Use Pydantic AI or JSON Schemas to define what the agent receives and returns.\\n✸ Avoid messy text — think like an API.\\n→ Tool: Pydantic AI, LangChain Output Parsers\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: Prompt, Tune, and Define Agent Protocol\\n✸ Start with role-based system prompts\\n✸ Use Prompt Tuning or Prefix Tuning for consistent persona and task behavior\\n✸ Use MCP to standardize how your agent handles inputs, tools, and outputs across modules.\\n→ Tools: GPT-4, Claude, MCP, Prompt Tuning\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰: Add Reasoning and Tool Use\\n✸ Equip the agent with reasoning frameworks:\\n☆ ReAct (Reasoning + Action)\\n☆ Chain-of-Thought\\n✸ Allow access to tools like web search, code interpreters, or document retrievers.\\n→ Tools: LangChain, OpenAI Tools, ReAct Framework\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱: Structure Multi-Agent Logic (if needed)\\n✸ Use orchestration frameworks to define agent roles and coordination.\\n✸ Create Planner, Researcher, Reporter agents — each with its own input/output schema.\\n→ Tools: CrewAI, LangGraph, OpenAI Swarm\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟲: Add Memory and Long-Term Context\\n✸ Does your agent need to remember what happened earlier?\\n✸ Use conversational memory, summary memory, or vector-based memory.\\n→ Tools: Zep, LangChain Memory, Chroma\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟳: Add Voice or Vision Capabilities (Optional)\\n✸ Text-to-speech: Use Coqui or ElevenLabs\\n✸ Image understanding: Use GPT-4o or LLaMA 3.2 Vision\\n→ Let your agent see and speak.\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟴: Deliver the Output (in Human or Machine Format)\\n✸ Format outputs into Markdown → PDF or structured JSON\\n✸ Output must be both readable and parsable\\n→ Tools: Pydantic AI, Markdown-to-PDF, LangChain Output Parsers\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟵: Wrap in a UI or API (Optional)\\n✸ Create a front-end or expose your agent via API\\n✸ Use Gradio, Streamlit, or FastAPI\\n→ This is what turns your agent into a product.\\n\\n》𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭𝟬: Evaluate and Monitor Your Agent’s Performance\\n✸ Run test prompts and toolchains to ensure reliability and consistency.\\n✸ Use logs, benchmarks, and feedback loops to improve over time.\\n→ Tools: MCP Logs, OpenAI Evaluation API, Custom Metrics Dashboards\\n\\n≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣\\n\\n⫸ꆛ Want to Build Real-World AI Agents?\\n\\nJoin My 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀-𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝟱-𝗶𝗻-𝟭 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 — Now with 𝗠𝗖𝗣!\\n➠ Build Real-World Agents for Healthcare,

We can achieve this because AI agents have different limitations than humans and have less need for compartmentalization and separation than human organizations and teams.\\n\\n \\n\\n[The AI-driven

Teams are stretched thin trying to manage conversations, handle follow-ups, and maintain consistent service around the clock.\\n\\nAs your business grows, these demands only get more complex, and relying on basic automation for routine tasks often leads to slower response times.\\n\\nUnlike traditional bots, AI agents are built to understand intent and adapt to different scenarios. They can act intelligently, respond in context, and improve over time.\\n\\nIn this article, we’ll explore the best AI agents and highlight platforms that help you automate support. We\\'ll also discover which [AI chatbot solution](https://denser.ai/blog/chatbot-solutions/) will help future-proof your business and simplify how your team delivers value.\\n\\n## What Is an AI Agent?\\n\\nAn [AI agent](https://denser.ai/blog/ai-agents-examples/) is an autonomous software system that observes its environment, analyzes inputs, and takes action toward a goal without human intervention.\\n\\nCompared to basic scripts or rule-based programs, AI agents are powered by artificial intelligence.\\n\\nThey understand context and adapt their behavior over time. They operate in a continuous sense-decide-act cycle by perceiving inputs, choosing the best response, and then carrying out a task.\\n\\nTraditional chatbots are often rule-based since they respond only to specific keywords or preset prompts.\\n\\nIn contrast, [conversational AI chatbots](https://denser.ai/blog/conversational-ai-chatbot-companies/) use advanced natural language understanding to grasp a user’s intent and context. They can handle more varied inquiries, and many improve with every interaction, gradually becoming a more powerful tool in your digital strategy.\\n\\n## Why Are AI Agents the Key to Operational Efficiency?\\n\\nUsing AI agents in your business lets you automate time-consuming, repetitive tasks such as responding to FAQs, routing tickets, scheduling meetings, or retrieving data.\\n\\nOffloading these tasks lets your human team concentrate on higher-level work that requires empathy, critical thinking, or creativity.\\n\\nAnother reason to adopt AI agents is the consistency and accuracy they bring to your daily operations. Because they respond based on verified content and structured logic, their output often makes sense in a way that improves clarity and reduces mistakes.\\n\\nYou can [train an AI chatbot](https://denser.ai/blog/train-ai-chatbot/) on your documentation, policies, or internal [knowledge base](https://denser.ai/blog/chatbot-knowledge-base/) for it to respond with precision and cite its sources when needed.\\n\\nFinally, integrating AI agents prepares your organization for long-term adaptability. With the ability to learn, adapt, and integrate across systems, these agents develop alongside your needs.\\n\\nAI agents help you stay competitive, meet rising expectations, and future-proof your operations with intelligent, actionable support.\\n\\n## 10 Best AI Agent Platforms in 2025\\n\\nWhen it comes to choosing an AI agent or chatbot solution, there are many options in the market. Below, we’ve compiled ten of the best AI agent platforms worth considering.\\n\\n### 1. Denser\\n\\n[Denser](https://denser.ai) is an enterprise AI agent and chatbot platform focused on easy deployment of custom AI support bots for websites and apps.\\n\\nThe standout feature of Denser is that you can train AI on your own knowledge sources. You can feed it your website content, documentation, PDF manuals, or data from Google Drive. Denser will automatically build an AI agent that can answer questions based on that content.\\n\\nThis is done through[retrieval-augmented generation](https://denser.ai/blog/rag/) (RAG). When a user asks something, the AI retrieves relevant information from your documents and uses it to formulate a precise answer.\\n\\nAnswers are accurate and come with cited sources for transparency. Denser can highlight the exact snippet in a PDF where the answer came from.\\n\\nYou can also deploy your AI agent on your website via a [chat widget](https://denser.ai/blog/website-chat-widget/), integrate it into platforms like Slack or Shopify, or use its API to connect elsewhere.\\n\\nDenser is a [no-code chatbot](https://denser.ai/blog/no-code-chatbot/).

Zendesk AI\\n\\n[Zendesk](https://denser.ai/blog/zendesk-competitor/) is a customer service software that also incorporates AI capabilities into its platform.\\n\\nImage Source: zendesk.com\\n\\nThe platform\\'s AI can autonomously handle simpler tickets across web, mobile, and social channels, providing 24/7 support to reduce the burden on your team. It uses your existing knowledge base articles and past tickets to generate answers.\\n\\nZendesk’s Agent Copilot helps live agents by suggesting reply drafts and next steps based on the context of the ticket. It can also auto-triage incoming requests by analyzing customer intent and sentiment, ensuring urgent issues get priority.\\n\\nHowever, advanced AI features can make Zendesk quite expensive for smaller organizations. New or small teams sometimes struggle, and it can be a bit overwhelming to learn all the flow builders, content connectors, and custom QA prompts.\\n\\n### 3. Intercom Fin\\n\\nFin is[Intercom](https://denser.ai/blog/intercom-alternatives/)’s AI chatbot solution built to deliver human-like customer interactions across chat, email, and more. Fin is powered by advanced AI and is trained on your Intercom help center articles, FAQs, and policies.\\n\\nImage Source: intercom.com\\n\\nFin is designed to operate continuously and handle a wide range of queries. It can carry on conversations naturally and then escalate to a human agent when it encounters something it can’t handle.\\n\\nCompanies use Fin to deflect routine inquiries and thus lighten the load on support teams. It’s also omnichannel, where it can assist customers on your website chat, in-app messenger, or via email.\\n\\nSome have mentioned missing features in reporting or integrations. While Fin integrates well with Intercom and some major platforms, custom integration scenarios might need work, and some reporting capabilities were basic.\\n\\n### 4. Freshdesk Freddy AI\\n\\nFreddy AI is a suite of AI tools offered by Freshworks, and Freshdesk is their customer support platform. Freddy includes an AI support agent that you can deploy without coding, plus an AI copilot to assist your human agents.\\n\\nThe Freddy virtual agent learns from your company’s knowledge base and past tickets to answer common questions across email, chat, and other channels. It’s capable of personalized, context-aware responses and supports multiple languages out of the box.\\n\\nImage Source: freshworks.com\\n\\nFor live support staff, Freddy’s Agent Copilot can summarize incoming tickets, suggest response templates, and adjust the tone of replies to match the customer’s mood. It also performs sentiment analysis to help prioritize critical issues.\\n\\nBut some of Freddy’s most powerful features, like the Freddy AI add-ons for agents or advanced bots, come at an extra cost. Users have also noted that they cannot customize certain AI behaviors or interface elements, which can be restrictive if your workflow is non-standard.\\n\\n### 5. Salesforce Einstein GPT\\n\\nSalesforce Einstein (now referred to as Einstein GPT with the addition of [generative AI](https://denser.ai/blog/generative-ai-glossary/)) is Salesforce’s integrated AI layer across its CRM and Service Cloud.\\n\\nEinstein AI agents can automate customer interactions on digital channels and help your team inside the Salesforce platform. For customer service, Einstein bots can handle chats, process rich inputs, and answer questions using data from your Salesforce knowledge base.\\n\\nImage Source: salesforce.com\\n\\nOn the agent side, Einstein can generate draft replies, summarize cases, and recommend the best action by analyzing CRM data and customer sentiment. For sales teams, Einstein can populate follow-up email text or update opportunity info.\\n\\nAs promising as generative AI is, the quality of its outputs depends on the data it’s trained and fed with. If your CRM data is outdated or inconsistent, the AI might produce irrelevant or incorrect answers.\\n\\nAnother drawback is that Einstein GPT is tied to the Salesforce ecosystem. It\\'s beneficial if you already use Salesforce’s platform, but it’s not a standalone chatbot you can plug elsewhere easily.\\n\\nThat said, Salesforce’s recent acquisition of Convergence AI suggests a broader shift toward AI. Agents can learn to adapt across dynamic workflows and enterprise-wide systems.\\n\\n### 6. Ada\\n\\nAda is an AI-powered customer service chatbot platform known for its no-code builder and automation capabilities. Ada’s AI agent connects to your existing content and performs actions via integrations.\\n\\nAda’s Reasoning Engine allows the bot to carry out tasks across other systems through API integrations. It can handle transactional requests end-to-end and supports omnichannel interactions, including web chat, mobile, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp.\\n\\nImage Source: ada.cx\\n\\nSeveral users mention that the initial setup and training of the Ada chatbot can be a heavy lift, and configuring complex intents and workflows may require some technical know-how.\\n\\nAnother limitation is that some integrations are not available. One user pointed out that Ada didn’t natively integrate with a tool like Zoho Desk, which was a drawback for their particular stack.\\n\\n### 7. Forethought\\n\\nForethought offers an AI solution for support teams centered on its virtual agent called Agatha. It\\'s designed to resolve support tickets across channels by detecting what the customer needs and retrieving the answer from your knowledge base.\\n\\nTheir Triage AI automatically tags and prioritizes incoming tickets by analyzing the issue described. The Assist AI gives human agents real-time suggestions while they’re working on a ticket.\\n\\nImage Source: forethought.ai\\n\\nHowever, some users feel that the platform’s cost is on the high side. Forethought’s rapid pace of adding new features also means the documentation or UI can occasionally lag. Some features feel a bit confusing or clunky until you get used to them.\\n\\n### 8. IBM Watson Assistant\\n\\nIBM’s Watson Assistant is an AI agent platform, now developed on the Watsonx infrastructure. IBM’s AI agents are known for their natural language understanding and enterprise-grade features.\\n\\nWatson Assistant allows you to build chatbots that can draw from FAQs, docs, and backend systems to answer user questions.\\n\\nImage Source: ibm.com\\n\\nThe platform provides a no-code interface with Watson Assistant’s dialog builder to design conversation flows. It also has more advanced options for data scientists to plug in machine learning models if desired.\\n\\nCost is one frequently mentioned drawback for small and mid-size businesses. IBM’s pricing is usage-based and requires higher plans for full features, which can be on the expensive side.\\n\\nSome reviewers also note that certain response types or chatbot elements, like buttons and carousels, were not as easily implemented out of the box and needed custom workarounds.\\n\\n### 9. Tidio Lyro\\n\\n[Tidio](https://denser.ai/blog/tidio-alternative/) is a customer service platform popular with small and mid-sized businesses. Lyro is designed as an out-of-the-box conversational AI chatbot that can be added to your website.\\n\\nLyro is powered by a large language model and Tidio’s own natural language processing engine. It strictly sticks to the information you provide and can handle common support queries, track orders, and has vision AI capabilities.\\n\\nImage Source: tidio.com\\n\\nWhile Lyro is powerful, its advanced features may require higher-tier plans, which can be limiting for small businesses on a tight budget. There can also be a slight learning curve when customizing complex automation sequences.\\n\\n### 10. Zoho Zia\\n\\nZoho Zia is the AI assistant integrated across Zoho’s suite of business applications. It serves as an AI agent inside Zoho Desk to help customers and support agents.\\n\\nZia can interact with customers via chat or email to answer questions by pulling answers from your company’s knowledge base and past tickets. It also uses sentiment analysis to gauge if a customer is unhappy or if an issue is urgent, and can escalate or notify a human when needed.\\n\\nImage Source: zoho.com\\n\\nFor internal teams, Zia provides AI-powered insights. It will auto-tag and categorize tickets, offer agents a summary of a customer’s issue, and suggest the best solution article.\\n\\nBut one commonly cited issue is limited customization, as it can be challenging to adjust the AI\\'s behavior to unique business workflows. Zia can also struggle with very complex or ambiguous queries, occasionally failing to interpret what the user means if the question isn’t direct.\\n\\n## Types of AI Agents\\n\\nAI agents range from simple reactive bots to sophisticated learning systems. Understanding the different [types of AI agents](https://denser.ai/blog/type-of-ai-agents/) will help you match the right solution to your needs:\\n\\n### Rule-Based Reflex Agents\\n\\nThese agents follow simple if-then rules. They react to specific triggers with pre-set responses, much like a basic [FAQ chatbot](https://denser.ai/blog/faq-chatbot/).\\n\\nFor example, a rule-based bot might always reply with store hours when it sees the word “hours.” They’re easy to set up but lack memory and cannot adapt, which is best for various tasks that are simple and repetitive.\\n\\n### Model-Based Agents\\n\\nThese agents have a notion of state as they remember past inputs to inform the current action. For instance, if a customer says \"I have an issue with my order\" and later types \"it hasn\\'t arrived,\" the agent recalls the context (the \"order issue\") and provides a relevant follow-up.\\n\\nKeeping track of context makes these bots better for multi-step conversations, like troubleshooting flows or order tracking.\\n\\n### Goal-Oriented Agents\\n\\nThese AI agents make decisions that move toward a defined goal. For example, a goal-driven sales chatbot might have the objective to get a demo scheduled.\\n\\nIt will ask questions and offer timeslots with the ultimate goal of booking that meeting. These agents evaluate actions by how much they bring the agent closer to the goal.\\n\\n### Utility-Based Agents\\n\\nThese agents use a utility function to choose the best among many possible actions, scoring options by expected usefulness.\\n\\nFor example, a product recommendation bot might consider multiple factors (customer preferences, price, popularity, etc.) and select the recommendation with the highest utility score.\\n\\n### Learning Agents\\n\\nThe most advanced category, learning agents, use [machine learning](https://denser.ai/blog/chatbot-machine-learning/) to improve their performance over time. They have components to explore new actions and a performance element that updates based on what they learn.\\n\\nThese agents might include built-in debugging tools to refine their responses after each interaction. Over time, they become more accurate and effective in helping customers or teams solve problems.\\n\\n## Common Business Use Cases for AI Agents\\n\\nAI agents are versatile and can be found improving operations across virtually every industry. Here are some of the most impactful use cases and applications of AI agents in businesses:\\n\\n### Customer Support and Service\\n\\n[AI in customer service](https://denser.ai/blog/benefits-of-ai-in-customer-service/) can handle large volumes of inquiries on websites, mobile apps, and messaging platforms. [AI agents for customer service](https://denser.ai/blog/top-ai-agents-for-customer-service/) answer FAQs, help users troubleshoot issues, and can escalate complex tasks to human staff when needed.\\n\\nThese agents understand customer intent and provide relevant answers, pulling from your knowledge base or FAQs. Many ecommerce sites and SaaS companies use AI-supported chatbots to great effect.\\n\\nDenser’s AI agents are designed to build AI agents that respond with context-aware replies and hand off to human agents when necessary. [Request a product demo](https://denser.ai/demo/) or [sign up for a free trial](https://denser.ai/u/auth/register/?redirect=%2Fbilling) today!\\n\\n### Sales and Marketing Assistants\\n\\n[AI sales chatbots](https://denser.ai/blog/ai-sales-chatbot/) can act as virtual sales agents or marketing assistants. They qualify leads by asking questions, recommending products or content, and helping schedule sales calls.\\n\\nIn marketing, AI outreach agents can send personalized follow-up emails or messages, track customer engagement, and help nurture leads through the funnel.\\n\\nThese agents use past browsing behavior or CRM info to tailor their approach. It improves results while allowing human teams to focus on higher-level strategy and write better campaigns.\\n\\nYou can also run these agents inside a browser to make them easy to access and deploy across your website or digital platform.\\n\\n### Ecommerce and Retail\\n\\nOnline retail uses AI agents for everything from product recommendation bots to virtual shopping assistants. [Retail AI chatbots](https://denser.ai/blog/retail-ai-chatbot/) on an ecommerce site can guide customers to find products that fit their needs, answer questions about orders or inventory, and handle reordering.\\n\\nSome advanced ecommerce agents adjust prices or offer discounts in real time based on demand and user behavior. These uses reduce the load on customer service and create a more interactive shopping experience.\\n\\n### Healthcare Assistants\\n\\nClinics and healthcare providers employ AI agents to speed up patient interaction and pre-visit processes.\\n\\nTypical examples are symptom-checker chatbots that ask patients about symptoms and provide preliminary advice or triage, such as: “If you have X, you might need to schedule an appointment.”\\n\\n[AI agents for healthcare](https://denser.ai/blog/ai-agents-for-healthcare/) also assist with appointment booking, sending reminders, and answering health FAQs (e.g., “What’s the prep for my blood test?”). These agents help reduce staff workload and ensure patients get timely information.\\n\\nHospitals have also started using AI agents to gather patient history or screen for certain conditions before the doctor ever speaks to the patient. Some research teams experiment with open-source healthcare agents to ensure flexibility in deployment and data control.\\n\\n### Education and Training\\n\\nIn e-learning platforms and corporate training, AI agents serve as virtual tutors or assistants. They can answer student questions 24/7, provide feedback on quizzes, or grade simple assignments.\\n\\nFor example, an [AI chatbot for education institutions](https://denser.ai/solutions/education/) might guide a student through a complex math problem by providing hints, while another agent auto-grades their practice tests.\\n\\nBusinesses also use training bots to onboard new employees, answer HR questions, or help them find resources.\\n\\n### Operations and Logistics\\n\\nIn supply chain and logistics, agents can monitor inventory levels, track shipments, or automatically reroute deliveries when there’s a disruption.\\n\\nFor example, a logistics bot might detect a delay at a warehouse and proactively reorder stock or update delivery estimates.\\n\\nInternal operations agents can also assist employees, such as an [IT support chatbot](https://denser.ai/blog/chatbot-for-it-support/) that helps staff reset passwords or file tech support tickets without waiting for helpdesk staff.\\n\\n### Finance and Security\\n\\n[AI is used in fintech](https://denser.ai/blog/how-is-ai-used-in-fintech/) for tasks like fraud detection and customer account support. [Fintech chatbots](https://denser.ai/blog/fintech-chatbots/) can monitor transactions in real time and flag unusual activity, automatically freeze a card, and alert the user for confirmation.\\n\\nBanks also deploy chat agents to answer customer questions about account balances, guide them through loan applications, or help with budgeting tips. These agents often connect with internal systems to execute transactions or update records securely.\\n\\n### Human Resources and Internal Helpdesks\\n\\n[AI in HR](https://denser.ai/blog/ai-in-hr-examples/) helps answer common questions about company policy, assists with benefits enrollment, or schedules interviews with job candidates. Internal knowledge base agents help employees find information or documentation.\\n\\n## Best Practices for Implementing AI Agents Successfully\\n\\nThe way you implement and manage your AI agent will determine its success. Here are some best practices and tips to make sure your AI agent delivers real results:\\n\\n### Start With a Narrow Focus\\n\\nWhen you first deploy an AI agent, begin with a specific, well-defined use case or task. For example, you can launch it to handle password reset requests or basic FAQ answers initially.\\n\\nStarting small helps you validate that the agent works correctly and lets it gather data in a controlled scope.\\n\\nYou can then gradually expand its responsibilities as it proves itself. This phased approach prevents the bot from getting overwhelmed or going wrong in complex scenarios early on.\\n\\n### Ensure High-Quality Knowledge Base/Data\\n\\nAI agents are only as good as the information they have. Before launching, you need to audit the data or content you’ll feed into the agent. Clean up any outdated FAQs, make sure your product info is current, and fill knowledge gaps where you know customers ask questions.\\n\\nIf you’re connecting to databases, check that the data is accurate and accessible. This kind of upfront research makes sure your AI agent delivers consistent answers and doesn’t rely on assumptions.\\n\\n### Define Clear Escalation Rules\\n\\nNo matter how good your AI agent is, there will be questions or situations it can’t handle. You need to plan for these by defining when and how the bot hands off to a human.\\n\\nYou might decide that if an AI agent sees a customer mention “cancel account” or detects very negative sentiment, it should tag a human agent to step in immediately. Set up triggers such as “if the AI provides two answers and the user is still unhappy, route to live chat.”\\n\\nMake sure the escalation process is smooth. The human agent should get the conversation history and context so the customer doesn’t have to repeat themselves.\\n\\n### Test in a Sandbox Environment\\n\\nBefore fully rolling out your AI agent to all users, use a staging or sandbox setup to simulate real interactions without impact on actual customers.\\n\\nYou may have team members throw sample questions or feed it historical chat logs to see how it responds. This phase also helps evaluate workflow automations under safe conditions, so you can catch misfires before they affect real users.\\n\\n### Monitor and Tune Performance Continuously\\n\\nOnce your AI agent is live, you need to assign someone on your team to regularly monitor the bot’s performance via dashboards and conversation transcripts. Watch metrics like resolution rate, confusion rate, user ratings, and any escalation frequencies.\\n\\nYou need to make performance reviews part of your regular AI workflows. This helps you catch weak points and refine your agent’s behavior, so it continues to deliver value in a real-world setting.\\n\\n## Intelligent AI Agents Without the Complex Setup—Choose Denser!\\n\\nAI agents are becoming essential for running smarter, faster businesses.

Kus detailed the critical shift from initial, often brittle, LLM-based solutions to a robust, multi-step agentic framework designed to tackle the formidable challenge of unstructured enterprise data.\\n\\nKus shared that Box’s initial foray into AI in 2023 involved deploying LLMs for tasks like metadata extraction, summarization, and Q&A. While promising for simple use cases, these pure LLM approaches quickly hit a wall when confronted with the vast, often messy, and highly variable unstructured data prevalent across enterprise documents. The core problem was reliability. LLMs, despite their intelligence, proved prone to “hallucinations, inconsistency, and fragility,” making them unsuitable for mission-critical data extraction where accuracy is paramount. Debugging these black-box systems was notoriously difficult, leading to what Kus described as “despair” within the engineering teams.\\n\\nThis frustration catalyzed a fundamental architectural pivot. Box recognized that an LLM is a powerful “brain,” but it requires a sophisticated operational framework to be truly effective. The solution was an agentic architecture, where the LLM acts as the central reasoning engine, but is equipped with a suite of tools—ranging from traditional regex patterns to external APIs—and operates within a structured “Plan, Act, Observe, Reflect” loop. This framework allows the agent to intelligently assess a task, select the appropriate tools, execute steps, validate outcomes, and self-correct, much like a human expert.\\n \\n\\nFor instance, extracting an invoice number no longer relies solely on an LLM guessing the correct string. Instead, the agent first identifies the document type, then employs a precise regex tool for structured fields, only resorting to the LLM for more ambiguous or unstructured text. This hybrid approach significantly boosts accuracy and reduces the common pitfalls of pure generative models. It provides a level of observability that was previously impossible, allowing engineers to trace the agent’s decision-making process and pinpoint errors.\\n\\nA crucial takeaway from Box’s experience, articulated emphatically by Kus, is the imperative to adopt an agentic architecture from the outset for any serious AI application. “If you’re building any kind of serious AI application, you should be building an agentic architecture from day one,” he advised. Attempting to retrofit such a system onto a pure LLM foundation is far more complex and costly than designing it in from the ground up. This proactive approach ensures scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness by judiciously deploying LLM compute only when necessary, rather than for every single step. Box’s journey underscores that for enterprise AI, the future is not just about smarter models, but smarter systems that orchestrate those models with precision and purpose.\\n\\n[Agentic AI](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/agentic-ai/)[AI](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/ai/)[Ben Kus](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/ben-kus/)[Box](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/box/)[Enterprise Software](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/enterprise-software/)[LLM](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/llm/)[Product Innovation](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/product-innovation/)[Unstructured Data](https://www.startuphub.ai/tag/unstructured-data/) \\n\\n### Trending Startups\\n\\nAI Agents and Tools\\n\\n[#### Kubiya](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/kubiya/)\\n\\n[#### Rocket.new](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/rocket-new/)\\n\\n[#### PROMAI](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/promai/)\\n\\n[#### AI21 Labs](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/ai21/)\\n\\n[#### Lema Labs](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/lema-labs/)\\n\\n[#### Dream](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/dream/)\\n\\n[#### Fabrix Security](https://www.startuphub.ai/startups/fabrix-security/)\\n\\nLoading next article\\n\\n### 🔥 Trending Startups\\n\\nUpdated Daily\\n\\n© 2025 StartupHub.ai.

They boast a significant client base, including 67% of the Fortune 500 and 115,000 total customers, emphasizing secure and safe AI deployments given the sensitive nature of enterprise data.\\n\\nInitial AI Deployment in 2023 [[01:50](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=110s)]: Box began its generative AI journey in 2023, introducing features like Q&A across documents, data extraction, and AI-powered workflows. The speaker, Ben Kus, highlights data extraction as a particularly interesting application, despite its seemingly less \"agentic\" nature.\\n\\nThe Challenge of Unstructured Data in Enterprises [[02:54](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=174s)]: Enterprise data is predominantly unstructured, with about “90% of enterprise data is unstructured, with critical metadata buried deep within” [[03:22](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=202s)]. This presents a significant challenge for automation and effective utilization, as valuable information often remains inaccessible.\\n\\nLimitations of Pre-Generative AI Data Extraction [[03:56](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=236s)]: Before generative AI, data extraction was “too hard for most enterprises” [[03:56](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=236s)]. Existing ML-based techniques were expensive to develop, “didn\\'t work well for free form text data”, and were “not responsive to data format changes” [[03:56](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=236s)]. This rigidity made it difficult to automate the processing of critical unstructured data for many companies.\\n\\nFirst Version: LLM-Based Extraction [[04:54](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=294s)]: The initial approach utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract data by simply prompting the model to “extract the fields <fields> from text: <text>” [[04:54](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=294s)]. This method “performed well” [[04:54](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=294s)] initially, offering flexibility and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs, and was seen as a significant leap forward compared to previous ML techniques.\\n\\nChallenges with the Pure LLM Approach [[07:05](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=425s)]: As complexity increased, the simple LLM approach faced several challenges. Complex documents and varying data formats led to difficulties, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) sometimes “lose valuable info” [[07:09](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=429s)], and too many fields could “overwhelm the LLM” [[07:44](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=464s)]. Furthermore, LLMs “didn’t know their own accuracy” [[08:14](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=494s)], making it hard to trust the output in enterprise settings.\\n\\nDespair and the Need for a New Architecture [[08:58](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=538s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH)]: These mounting challenges led to a \"despair moment\" [[08:58](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=538s)] where the team realized their “simple, elegant LLM-powered architecture became convoluted, fragile, and hard to update” [[08:58](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=538s)]. The fragility stemmed from needing constant adjustments and auxiliary steps to manage the LLM\\'s limitations.\\n\\nIntroducing Agentic Architecture [[09:30](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=570s)]: The solution was to adopt an agentic architecture for the Box platform. This involves an AI model at its core, supported by instructions to guide its actions, a defined set of objectives, and a range of capabilities and tools (e.g., summarization, classification). The system is designed with secure access to content [[09:30](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=570s)].\\n\\nAI Agent Reasoning Framework [[10:04](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=604s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH)]: The AI agents operate driven by an advanced agentic reasoning framework which is structured around several stages: Plan (set objective, understand goal, identify tools/data), Discover and Comprehend (absorb context, retrieve relevant content, ground in enterprise knowledge), Analyze and Iterate (think through solutions, generate final output, log decisions), and Synthesize and Execute (deliver outcome, generate final output, log decisions) [[10:04](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=604s)]. This iterative approach allows for more complex and robust problem-solving.\\n\\nAgentic Routine for Data Extraction [[10:45](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=645s)]: For data extraction specifically, the agentic approach involves a Box AI Extract Agent and an Extract Supervisor. The process includes steps to prepare fields (intelligently group fields, break into groups), extract field data (using tools like eRAG, OCR, and multiple models), and quality feedback (LLM as a judge, reflection/recommendations for updates) [[10:45](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=645s)]. This structured workflow overcomes the limitations of direct LLM prompting.\\n\\nAdvantages of Agentic Architecture [[12:28](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=748s)]: The agentic architecture offers significant benefits. It provides a cleaner platform abstraction, making it easier to separate high-scale infrastructure work from specific agent actions. It ensures ease to evolve quickly as new techniques and AI models become available. Most importantly, it fosters an improved engineering AI culture, where engineers think agentically and focus on state diagrams, tools, and inter-agent communication [[14:05](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=845s)].\\n\\nKey Lesson Learned: Build Agentic Architecture Early [[14:05](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=845s)]: A crucial takeaway from Box\\'s journey is the importance of building an agentic architecture early. This proactive approach allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and problem-solving capacity when dealing with the evolving complexities of AI and unstructured data.\\n\\nApproach to Fine-tuning and Model Support [[18:37](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1117s)]: Box currently maintains an anti-fine-tuning stance for its models. The reason is the difficulty in consistently fine-tuning across multiple models and their subsequent evolutions. Instead, they prefer using prompts and cached prompts in their agentic framework, finding that newer model versions often provide sufficient improvements, thus avoiding the overhead of continuous fine-tuning.\\n\\nShow less\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n  Like\\n\\n  Dislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n### @impendingbloom\\n\\n[3 hours ago](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&lc=UgzikXicDEJdiGG1x214AaABAg)\\n\\n Nice graphics\\n\\nShow less\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n  Like\\n\\n  Dislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n### @sliferway\\n\\n[1 hour ago](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&lc=Ugw5O-ggzBI51wukZdZ4AaABAg)\\n\\n The voice kills me\\n\\nShow less\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n  Like\\n\\n    1\\n  \\n\\n  Dislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n### @impendingbloom\\n\\n[3 hours ago](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&lc=Ugxf7MTzTzwuhJ69x6F4AaABAg)\\n\\n Old school drum machine sound\\n\\nShow less\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n  Like\\n\\n  Dislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n## Comments4\\n\\n \\n\\nTop comments\\nNewest first\\n\\n## In this video\\n\\nTimelineChaptersTranscript\\n\\n## Chapters\\n\\n[#### Box\\'s Content Platform and Enterprise Focus#### Box\\'s Content Platform and Enterprise Focus0:00](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY)\\n\\n[#### Box\\'s Content Platform and Enterprise Focus](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY)\\n0:00\\n\\n[#### Initial AI Deployment in 2023#### Initial AI Deployment in 20231:50](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=110s)\\n\\n[#### Initial AI Deployment in 2023](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=110s)\\n1:50\\n\\n[#### The Challenge of Unstructured Data in Enterprises#### The Challenge of Unstructured Data in Enterprises2:54](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=174s)\\n\\n[#### The Challenge of Unstructured Data in Enterprises](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=174s)\\n2:54\\n\\n[#### Limitations of Pre-Generative AI Data Extraction#### Limitations of Pre-Generative AI Data Extraction3:56](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=236s)\\n\\n[#### Limitations of Pre-Generative AI Data Extraction](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=236s)\\n3:56\\n\\n[#### First Version: LLM-Based Extraction#### First Version: LLM-Based Extraction4:54](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=294s)\\n\\n[#### First Version: LLM-Based Extraction](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=294s)\\n4:54\\n\\n[#### Challenges with the Pure LLM Approach#### Challenges with the Pure LLM Approach7:05](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=425s)\\n\\n[#### Challenges with the Pure LLM Approach](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=425s)\\n7:05\\n\\n[#### Despair and the Need for a New Architecture#### Despair and the Need for a New Architecture8:58](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=538s)\\n\\n[#### Despair and the Need for a New Architecture](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=538s)\\n8:58\\n\\n[#### Introducing Agentic Architecture#### Introducing Agentic Architecture9:30](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=570s&pp=0gcJCdcCDuyUWbzu)\\n\\n[#### Introducing Agentic Architecture](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=570s&pp=0gcJCdcCDuyUWbzu)\\n9:30\\n\\n[#### AI Agent Reasoning Framework#### AI Agent Reasoning Framework10:04](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=604s)\\n\\n[#### AI Agent Reasoning Framework](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=604s)\\n10:04\\n\\n[#### Agentic Routine for Data Extraction#### Agentic Routine for Data Extraction10:45](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=645s)\\n\\n[#### Agentic Routine for Data Extraction](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=645s)\\n10:45\\n\\n[#### Advantages of Agentic Architecture#### Advantages of Agentic Architecture12:28](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=748s)\\n\\n[#### Advantages of Agentic Architecture](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=748s)\\n12:28\\n\\n[#### Key Lesson Learned: Build Agentic Architecture Early#### Key Lesson Learned: Build Agentic Architecture Early14:05](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=845s)\\n\\n[#### Key Lesson Learned: Build Agentic Architecture Early](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=845s)\\n14:05\\n\\n[#### Approach to Fine-tuning and Model Support#### Approach to Fine-tuning and Model Support18:37](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1117s)\\n\\n[#### Approach to Fine-tuning and Model Support](/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1117s)\\n18:37\\n\\nSync to video time\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nBuilding an Agentic Platform — Ben Kus, CTO Box\\n\\nExplore the technical evolution of metadata extraction at Box and how it shaped the foundation of our AI platform.

While generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have captured headlines, their practical deployment in business-critical systems has been hampered by fragmented architectures, outdated data, and the complexity of integrating AI with operational workflows. Enter **Confluent's Streaming Agents**, a breakthrough in data streaming technology that positions the company as a critical infrastructure play in the AI automation boom.  \\n### The Problem with Agentic AI: A Fragmented Landscape\\n\\nAgentic AI—systems that can autonomously reason, act, and adapt—has long been heralded as the next frontier in enterprise software. However, IDC research reveals a stark reality: **enterprises launch 23 generative AI proof-of-concept (PoC) projects annually, but only three reach production**, and **62% of those meet expectations**. Why? Traditional agentic AI systems often rely on siloed data, batch processing, and manual integrations, leading to delayed decisions, inconsistent outcomes, and high costs.  \\n\\nAsk Aime: \\nCan you explain why only 3 out of 23 generative AI projects actually go into production and how it affects market trends?\\n\\nConfluent's **Streaming Agents**, launched in August 2025, directly address these pain points by embedding AI into **real-time data streams**. Built on Apache Flink and [Confluent](//www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-CFLT/)[CFLT--](//www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-CFLT/) Cloud, the platform unifies stream processing, AI reasoning, and secure tool integration, enabling enterprises to deploy scalable, context-aware automation.  \\n### How Streaming Agents Unlock Enterprise AI's Potential\\n\\nThe core innovation of Streaming Agents lies in its ability to **process events as they occur**, ensuring AI agents operate on the most current data. Here's how it works:  \\n1. **Context-Aware Automation via Tool Calling**Streaming Agents use the**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**to dynamically invoke external tools—databases, SaaS platforms, APIs—based on real-time events. For example, a telecom company can detect network failures by analyzing sensor data and weather reports, then automatically trigger incident management systems to resolve outages.Ask Aime:Is the new streaming technology helping AI in businesses work better?\\n2. **Real-Time Data Enrichment**By integrating with non-Kafka sources like relational databases and vector databases, Streaming Agents enrich streaming data with contextual information. This is critical for**retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**applications, where AI agents must reference up-to-date data to generate accurate insights.\\n3. **Secure, Scalable Deployment**The platform ensures**zero-exposure of sensitive credentials**and supports reusable integrations, enabling enterprises to scale AI workflows without compromising security. Role-based access control (RBAC) and audit logging further align with governance standards.\\n4. **Replayability for Iteration and Safety**Streaming Agents allow teams to test logic using historical event logs without affecting live systems. This “dark launch” capability accelerates development cycles and reduces risk, a critical advantage in high-stakes industries like finance or healthcare.\\n### Real-World Applications: From Pricing to Anomaly Detection\\n\\nThe versatility of Streaming Agents is evident in its use cases:\\n- **Retail**: Automate dynamic pricing by monitoring competitor websites, inventory levels, and customer behavior in real time.\\n- **Telecom**: Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) by detecting network anomalies and triggering automated remediation workflows.\\n- **Customer Service**: Deploy LLM-powered agents that access live customer data to resolve issues instantly, mimicking human-like responsiveness.  \\n\\nThese applications highlight Confluent's shift from **prediction-based AI** to **action-driven automation**, a trend poised to redefine enterprise software.  \\n### Market Position and Growth Potential\\n\\nConfluent's Streaming Agents are not just a product—they're a **platform for the future of enterprise AI**. With the global AI automation market projected to grow at a 30% CAGR through 2030, Confluent's focus on real-time data integration positions it as a foundational layer for AI-driven workflows.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe open preview launch of Streaming Agents has already attracted early adopters in sectors like logistics and fintech, where real-time decision-making is mission-critical. Meanwhile, Confluent's partnership with Apache Flink and its ecosystem of tools (e.g., vector databases, LLMs) creates a **network effect**, making it harder for competitors to replicate its end-to-end solution.  \\n### Investment Considerations: A Critical Infrastructure Play\\n\\nFor investors, Confluent represents a **high-conviction opportunity** in the AI infrastructure space. While the company faces competition from cloud giants like AWS and [Google](//www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-GOOGL/)[GOOGL--](//www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-GOOGL/) Cloud, its **specialization in real-time data streaming** and **enterprise-grade governance** differentiates it. Key metrics to watch include:\\n- **Customer adoption rates** of Streaming Agents.\\n- **Revenue growth** from Confluent Cloud, which now accounts for over 60% of total revenue.\\n- **Partnership expansion** with LLM providers and SaaS platforms.  \\n\\nHowever, risks remain. The AI automation market is still maturing, and regulatory scrutiny of AI could slow adoption. That said, Confluent's focus on **secure, auditable workflows** aligns with emerging compliance requirements, mitigating this risk.  \\n### Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future of AI\\n\\nConfluent's Streaming Agents are more than a technical innovation—they're a **paradigm shift** in how enterprises deploy AI. By solving the real-time data integration problem, Confluent is enabling a new era of **self-sufficient, event-driven systems** that can scale across industries. For investors seeking exposure to the AI automation boom, CFLT offers a compelling thesis: a company building the infrastructure that will power the next generation of enterprise software.  \\n\\nAs the line between data and action blurs, Confluent is not just keeping up with the AI revolution—it's leading it.\\nWhatsappLinkXFacebookLinkedin## AInvest Newsletter\\n\\nDaily stocks & crypto headlines, free to your inbox\\nGet Newsletter with EmailContinue with Google### Or continue with others\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\uf8ff\\u2005Continue with Apple\\n\\nFacebookX\\nBy continuing, I agree to the [Market Data Terms of Service](https://cdn.ainvest.com/agreement/Ainvest-Fintech-Terms-of-Use.pdf) and [Privacy Statement](https://cdn.ainvest.com/agreement/Ainvest-Fintech-Inc-Privacy-Policy.pdf)\\n## Aime Insights\\n\\n### Comments\\n\\n\\ufeff\\n\\nAdd a public comment...PostLoading comments...Top News[The Trump Administration's $8.9 Billion Intel Stake: A New Era in U.S. Industrial Policy and Shareholder ValueIsaac Lane08/22](https://www.ainvest.com/news/trump-administration-8-9-billion-intel-stake-era-industrial-policy-shareholder-2508/)[Powell Speech Takeaways: Fed Put Is Back!!!Wallstreet Insight08/22](https://www.ainvest.com/news/powell-speech-takeaways-fed-put-2508/)[Ukraine drone strike hits Russian nuclear plant, ignites large fire at Novatek's Ust-Luga terminalAinvest12h ago](https://www.ainvest.com/news/ukraine-drone-strike-hits-russian-nuclear-plant-ignites-large-fire-novatek-ust-luga-terminal-2508/)Related Articles[ServiceNow: Pioneering the AI-Driven Enterprise Software RevolutionAInvest07/26](https://www.ainvest.com/news/servicenow-pioneering-ai-driven-enterprise-software-revolution-2507/)[Confluent's Accelerating Cloud Revenue and Margin Expansion: A Compelling Buy for the AI-Driven Era?AInvest07/31](https://www.ainvest.com/news/confluent-accelerating-cloud-revenue-margin-expansion-compelling-buy-ai-driven-era-2507/)[Confluent's Crossroads: Navigating Cloud Optimization Headwinds While Building AI Infrastructure for TomorrowAInvest08/17](https://www.ainvest.com/news/confluent-crossroads-navigating-cloud-optimization-headwinds-building-ai-infrastructure-tomorrow-2508/)Trending News[Sonos: Green Shoots Might Be EmergingRhys Northwood08/21](https://h5.ainvest.com/frontPage/regular/news-page/index.html?id=sonos-green-shoots-emerging-2508-31&lang=)[XRP News Today: Gemini Unveils XRP Mastercard with 4% Cashback on August 25Coin World08/23](https://h5.ainvest.com/frontPage/regular/news-page/index.html?id=xrp-news-today-gemini-unveils-xrp-mastercard-4-cashback-august-25-2508&lang=)\\nView More\\nDisclaimer: The news articles available on this platform are generated in whole or in part by artificial intelligence and may not have been reviewed or fact checked by human editors.

       "[{'markdown_summary': '### Summary of \"Agentic AI: What is it and why are people talking about it?\" by Cecily Mauran\\n\\nThe article by Cecily Mauran on Mashable discusses the emerging trend of \"agentic AI,\" a new concept in artificial intelligence that is gaining significant attention in 2025. Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to operate autonomously, perceive their environment, set goals, plan actions, and execute those plans without continuous human intervention. This type of AI can learn and adapt over time based on feedback and new information.\\n\\n#### Key Points:\\n1. **Definition and Characteristics**:\\n   - Agentic AI systems are distinct from generative AI, which primarily creates outputs like text, audio, or images.\\n   - These systems can autonomously perform tasks on behalf of users, such as conducting internet searches, analyzing results, and completing tasks in other applications.\\n   - They are powered by advanced reasoning models, like ChatGPT o3 and Google\\'s Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, which can break down complex tasks and make inferences.\\n\\n2. **Current Developments**:\\n   - Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are leading the development of agentic AI technologies.\\n   - Google announced its \"agentic era\" with tools like a web browsing research assistant and an AI bot that can make calls to businesses.\\n   - OpenAI introduced Operator, an AI agent for performing tasks, and Deep Research, an agentic AI tool for conducting multi-step research online.\\n   - Microsoft unveiled Microsoft Discover, an enterprise agentic AI tool for scientists.\\n\\n3. **Applications and Potential**:\\n   - Agentic AI has the potential to automate daily tasks such as email responses, online shopping, and customer service inquiries.\\n   - It is seen as a step towards making AI tools like ChatGPT indispensable for businesses and individuals.\\n\\n4. **Challenges and Risks**:\\n   - There are concerns about the risks of autonomous AI, such as sending sensitive information to the wrong recipients or making unintended purchases.\\n   - Liability issues arise when AI agents make decisions that could have negative consequences.\\n   - The extensive data access required by these agents raises privacy concerns.\\n   - There is a potential for sophisticated cyberattacks using agentic AI by malicious actors.\\n\\n5. **Industry Safeguards**:\\n   - Major AI companies are implementing safeguards to prevent AI agents from acting independently without human oversight.\\n   - OpenAI, for example, has restrictions on its Operator tool to prevent it from performing sensitive tasks like banking transactions without human approval.\\n\\n6. **Future Considerations**:\\n   - As agentic AI becomes more prevalent, there is a concern about human dependency on AI for learning and decision-making.\\n   - The article raises questions about whether reliance on AI could lead to a decline in human cognitive abilities.\\n\\nThe article provides an insightful overview of the current state and future potential of agentic AI, highlighting both its transformative possibilities and the ethical and practical challenges it presents.',\n",

       " {'markdown_summary': '## Summary of \"Box CTO on Agentic AI: Beyond the Black Box of Pure LLMs\"\\n\\nIn an article dated August 24, 2025, Ben Kus, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Box, discusses the company\\'s journey in integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its enterprise content platform. Initially, Box employed large language models (LLMs) for tasks such as metadata extraction, summarization, and Q&A. However, these models faced significant challenges when dealing with unstructured enterprise data due to issues like hallucinations, inconsistency, and fragility, which made them unreliable for critical data extraction tasks.\\n\\nTo address these challenges, Box transitioned to an \"agentic\" architecture. This approach involves using the LLM as the central reasoning engine, supported by a suite of tools, including regex patterns and external APIs, within a structured \"Plan, Act, Observe, Reflect\" loop. This framework allows the AI system to intelligently assess tasks, select appropriate tools, execute steps, validate outcomes, and self-correct, similar to a human expert. For example, in extracting an invoice number, the agent first identifies the document type and uses a regex tool for structured fields, resorting to the LLM only for ambiguous text. This hybrid approach enhances accuracy and provides observability, allowing engineers to trace decision-making processes and pinpoint errors.\\n\\nBen Kus emphasizes the importance of adopting an agentic architecture from the outset for any serious AI application, as retrofitting such a system onto a pure LLM foundation is more complex and costly. This proactive approach ensures scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness by deploying LLM compute only when necessary.\\n\\nOverall, Box\\'s experience highlights that the future of enterprise AI lies not only in smarter models but also in smarter systems that orchestrate these models with precision and purpose.',\n",
